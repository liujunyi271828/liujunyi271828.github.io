新年前夕，国家主席习近平通过中央广播电视总台和互联网，发表了二〇二三年新年贺词。全文如下：

On New Year's eve, President Xi Jinping delivered his 2023 New Year Address through China Media Group and the Internet. The following is the full text of the address:

大家好！2023年即将到来，我在北京向大家致以美好的新年祝福！

Greetings to you all. The year 2023 is approaching. From Beijing, I extend my best New Year wishes to all of you.

2022年，我们胜利召开党的二十大，擘画了全面建设社会主义现代化国家、以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴的宏伟蓝图，吹响了奋进新征程的时代号角。

In 2022, we successfully convened the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). An ambitious blueprint has been drawn for building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, sounding a clarion call of the times for us forging ahead on a new journey.

我国继续保持世界第二大经济体的地位，经济稳健发展，全年国内生产总值预计超过120万亿元。面对全球粮食危机，我国粮食生产实现“十九连丰”，中国人的饭碗端得更牢了。我们巩固脱贫攻坚成果，全面推进乡村振兴，采取减税降费等系列措施为企业纾难解困，着力解决人民群众急难愁盼问题。

The Chinese economy has remained the second largest in the world and enjoyed sound development. GDP for the whole year is expected to exceed 120 trillion yuan. Despite a global food crisis, we have secured a bumper harvest for the 19th year in a row, putting us in a stronger position to ensure the food supply of the Chinese people. We have consolidated our gains in poverty elimination and advanced rural revitalization across the board. We have introduced tax and fee cuts and other measures to ease the burden on businesses, and made active efforts to solve the most pressing difficulties of high concern to the people.

疫情发生以来，我们始终坚持人民至上、生命至上，坚持科学精准防控，因时因势优化调整防控措施，最大限度保护了人民生命安全和身体健康。广大干部群众特别是医务人员、基层工作者不畏艰辛、勇毅坚守。经过艰苦卓绝的努力，我们战胜了前所未有的困难和挑战，每个人都不容易。目前，疫情防控进入新阶段，仍是吃劲的时候，大家都在坚忍不拔努力，曙光就在前头。大家再加把劲，坚持就是胜利，团结就是胜利。

Since COVID-19 struck, we have put the people first and put life first all along. Following a science-based and targeted approach, we have adapted our COVID response in light of the evolving situation to protect the life and health of the people to the greatest extent possible. Officials and the general public, particularly medical professionals and community workers, have bravely stuck to their posts through it all. With extraordinary efforts, we have prevailed over unprecedented difficulties and challenges, and it has not been an easy journey for anyone. We have now entered a new phase of COVID response where tough challenges remain. Everyone is holding on with great fortitude, and the light of hope is right in front of us. Let's make an extra effort to pull through, as perseverance and solidarity mean victory.

2022年，江泽民同志离开了我们。我们深切缅怀他的丰功伟绩和崇高风范，珍惜他留下的宝贵精神财富。我们要继承他的遗志，把新时代中国特色社会主义事业不断推向前进。

Comrade Jiang Zemin passed away in 2022. We pay high tribute to his towering achievements and noble demeanor, and cherish the great legacy he left behind. We will honor his last wishes and advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

历史长河波澜壮阔，一代又一代人接续奋斗创造了今天的中国。

Wave upon wave, the mighty river of history surges forward. With the persistent efforts of one generation after another, we have taken China to where it is today.

今天的中国，是梦想接连实现的中国。北京冬奥会、冬残奥会成功举办，冰雪健儿驰骋赛场，取得了骄人成绩。神舟十三号、十四号、十五号接力腾飞，中国空间站全面建成，我们的“太空之家”遨游苍穹。人民军队迎来95岁生日，广大官兵在强军伟业征程上昂扬奋进。第三艘航母“福建号”下水，首架C919大飞机正式交付，白鹤滩水电站全面投产……这一切，凝结着无数人的辛勤付出和汗水。点点星火，汇聚成炬，这就是中国力量！

Today's China is a country where dreams become reality. The Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games concluded with a resounding success. Chinese winter sports athletes gave their all and achieved extraordinary results. Shenzhou-13, Shenzhou-14 and Shenzhou-15 soared into the heavens. China's space station was fully completed and our "home in space" is roving in the deep-blue sky. The people's armed forces marked the 95th birthday and all service members are marching confidently on the great journey of building a strong military. China's third aircraft carrier Fujian was launched. C919, China's first large passenger aircraft, was delivered. And the Baihetan hydropower station went into full operation... None of these achievements would have been possible without the sweat and toil of the numerous Chinese people. Sparks of talent are coming together, and they are the strength of China!

今天的中国，是充满生机活力的中国。各自由贸易试验区、海南自由贸易港蓬勃兴起，沿海地区踊跃创新，中西部地区加快发展，东北振兴蓄势待发，边疆地区兴边富民。中国经济韧性强、潜力大、活力足，长期向好的基本面依然不变。只要笃定信心、稳中求进，就一定能实现我们的既定目标。今年我去了香港，看到香港将由治及兴十分欣慰。坚定不移落实好“一国两制”，香港、澳门必将长期繁荣稳定。

Today's China is a country brimming with vigor and vitality. Various pilot free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port are booming, innovations are gushing out in the coastal areas, development is picking up pace in the central and western regions, the momentum for revitalization is building in the northeast, and there is greater development and affluence in the border regions. The Chinese economy enjoys strong resilience, tremendous potential and great vitality. The fundamentals sustaining its long-term growth have remained strong. As long as we stay confident and strive for progress while maintaining stability, we will realize the goals we have set. On my visit to Hong Kong earlier this year, I was deeply glad to see that Hong Kong has restored order and is set to thrive again. With determined implementation of One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong and Macao will surely enjoy long-term prosperity and stability.

今天的中国，是赓续民族精神的中国。这一年发生的地震、洪水、干旱、山火等自然灾害和一些安全事故，让人揪心，令人难过，但一幕幕舍生取义、守望相助的场景感人至深，英雄的事迹永远铭记在我们心中。每当辞旧迎新，总会念及中华民族千年传承的浩然之气，倍增前行信心。

Today's China is a country that keeps to its national character. In the course of 2022, we encountered various natural disasters including earthquakes, floods, droughts and wildfires, and experienced some workplace accidents. Amid those disconcerting and heartbreaking scenes, there have emerged numerous touching stories of people sticking together in face of adversity or even sacrificing their lives to help others in distress. Those heroic deeds will be forever etched in our memories. At every turn of the year, we always think of the great character of resilience that the Chinese nation has carried forward through millennia. It gives us still greater confidence as we continue our way forward.

今天的中国，是紧密联系世界的中国。这一年，我在北京迎接了不少新老朋友，也走出国门讲述中国主张。百年变局加速演进，世界并不太平。我们始终如一珍视和平和发展，始终如一珍惜朋友和伙伴，坚定站在历史正确的一边、站在人类文明进步的一边，努力为人类和平与发展事业贡献中国智慧、中国方案。

Today's China is a country closely linked with the world. Over the past year, I have hosted quite a few friends, both old and new, in Beijing; I have also traveled abroad to communicate China's propositions to the world. Changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a faster pace, and the world is not yet a tranquil place. We cherish peace and development and value friends and partners as we have always done. We stand firm on the right side of history and on the side of human civilization and progress. We work hard to contribute China's wisdom and solutions to the cause of peace and development for all humanity.

党的二十大后我和同事们一起去了延安，重温党中央在延安时期战胜世所罕见困难的光辉岁月，感悟老一辈共产党人的精神力量。我常说，艰难困苦，玉汝于成。中国共产党百年栉风沐雨、披荆斩棘，历程何其艰辛又何其伟大。我们要一往无前、顽强拼搏，让明天的中国更美好。

After the 20th CPC National Congress, my colleagues and I visited Yan'an. We were there to relive the inspiring episode in which the Party's central leadership overcame extraordinary difficulties in the 1930s and 1940s, and to draw on the spiritual strength of the older generation of CPC members. I often say, "Just as polishing makes jade finer, adversity makes one stronger." Over the past 100 years, the CPC has braved wind and rain, and forged ahead against all odds. That is a most difficult yet great journey. Today, we must press on courageously to make tomorrow's China a better place.

明天的中国，奋斗创造奇迹。苏轼有句话：“犯其至难而图其至远”，意思是说“向最难之处攻坚，追求最远大的目标”。路虽远，行则将至；事虽难，做则必成。只要有愚公移山的志气、滴水穿石的毅力，脚踏实地，埋头苦干，积跬步以至千里，就一定能够把宏伟目标变为美好现实。

Going forward, China will be a country that performs miracles through hard work. Here I want to quote Su Shi, a renowned Chinese poet, "Charge at the toughest and aim at the farthest." It means to take on the biggest challenges and go after the most ambitious goals. Long as the journey is, we will reach our destination if we stay the course; difficult as the task is, we will get the job done if we keep working at it. As long as we have the resolve to move mountains and the perseverance to plod on, as long as we keep our feet on the ground and forge ahead with our journey by making steady progress, we will turn our grand goals into reality.

明天的中国，力量源于团结。中国这么大，不同人会有不同诉求，对同一件事也会有不同看法，这很正常，要通过沟通协商凝聚共识。14亿多中国人心往一处想、劲往一处使，同舟共济、众志成城，就没有干不成的事、迈不过的坎。海峡两岸一家亲。衷心希望两岸同胞相向而行、携手并进，共创中华民族绵长福祉。

Going forward, China will be a country that draws its strength from unity. Ours is a big country. It is only natural for different people to have different concerns or hold different views on the same issue. What matters is that we build consensus through communication and consultation. When the 1.4 billion Chinese work with one heart and one mind, and stand in unity with a strong will, no task will be impossible and no difficulty insurmountable. The people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are members of one and the same family. I sincerely hope that our compatriots on both sides of the Strait will work together with a unity of purpose to jointly foster lasting prosperity of the Chinese nation.

明天的中国，希望寄予青年。青年兴则国家兴，中国发展要靠广大青年挺膺担当。年轻充满朝气，青春孕育希望。广大青年要厚植家国情怀、涵养进取品格，以奋斗姿态激扬青春，不负时代，不负华年。

Going forward, China will be a country that has great expectations of its younger generation. A nation will prosper only when its young people thrive. For China to develop further, our young people must step forward and take on their responsibilities. Youth is full of vigor and is a source of hope. Youngsters should keep their country in mind, cultivate keen enterprise, and live youth to the fullest with great drive, to prove worthy of the times and the splendor of youth.

此时此刻，许多人还在辛苦忙碌，大家辛苦了！新年的钟声即将敲响，让我们怀着对未来的美好向往，共同迎接2023年的第一缕阳光。

To the many people who are still busy working at this very moment, I salute you all! We are about to ring in the New Year. Let us welcome the first ray of sunshine of 2023 with the best wishes for a brighter future.

祝愿祖国繁荣昌盛、国泰民安！祝愿世界和平美好、幸福安宁！祝愿大家新年快乐、皆得所愿！

May our country enjoy prosperity and our people live in harmony. May the world enjoy peace and people of all countries live in happiness. I wish you all a happy New Year and may all your wishes come true.

谢谢！

Thank you.
