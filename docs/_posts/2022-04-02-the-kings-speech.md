> 看了《国王的演讲》这个片儿，知道了这篇演讲。

《国王的演讲》（“The King’s Speech”）算是跟《至暗时刻》（“Darkest Hour”）互为姊妹篇了，风格感觉都差不多。还有一个算是两者后传的《敦刻尔克》（“Dunkirk”）。跟美国那种百花齐放的异想天开惊才绝艳比，感觉英国则是以学院派的朴实刚健稳扎稳打见长。我个人线上线下也多次称赞过英国人的文学水平，英国人的文章基本要比美国人写的看着要费事儿一点儿。

《国王的演讲》和《至暗时刻》这两个片子个人感觉都值得一看，主演演技在线，配乐也不错。当然这里我主要关心文学的部分。顺便吐槽一下，《国王的演讲》这片儿港版的译名《皇上无话儿》跟台版译名《王者之声：宣战时刻》简直不能更蠢更傻逼。老老实实忠实原文翻译出来不香吗，非得加那么多戏。。。

George VI, the British Monarch, made a live radio broadcast to the country and the Commonwealth declaring the outbreak of war with Germany. The King’s speech was made on 3 September 1939.

### [The King’s Speech](https://www.britpolitics.co.uk/speeches-george-vi-declaration-of-war/)

In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.

For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies. But it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict. For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilised order in the world.

It is the principle which permits a state, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other states.

Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right; and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger. But far more than this – the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended.

This is the ultimate issue which confronts us. For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world’s order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.

It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm, firm, and united in this time of trial. The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield. But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.

If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, ready for whatever service or sacrifice it may demand, then, with God’s help, we shall prevail.

May He bless and keep us all.”

George VI – September 3, 1939
