各位代表：<br/>Fellow Deputies,

现在，我代表国务院，向大会报告过去五年政府工作，对今年工作提出建议，请予审议，并请全国政协委员提出意见。<br/>On behalf of the State Council, I will now report to you on the government’s work of the past five years and lay out what we propose for this year’s work for your deliberation and approval. I also invite comments from the members of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).


**一、过去五年工作回顾**<br/>**I will begin with a review of our work over the past five years.**

第十二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议以来的五年，是我国发展进程中极不平凡的五年。面对极其错综复杂的国内外形势，以习近平同志为核心的党中央团结带领全国各族人民砥砺前行，统筹推进“五位一体”总体布局，协调推进“四个全面”战略布局，改革开放和社会主义现代化建设全面开创新局面。党的十九大确立了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的历史地位，制定了决胜全面建成小康社会、夺取新时代中国特色社会主义伟大胜利的宏伟蓝图和行动纲领，具有重大现实意义和深远历史意义。各地区各部门不断增强政治意识、大局意识、核心意识、看齐意识，深入贯彻落实新发展理念，“十二五”规划圆满完成，“十三五”规划顺利实施，经济社会发展取得历史性成就、发生历史性变革。<br/>The five years since the first session of the 12th National People’s Congress (NPC) have been a truly remarkable five years in the course of our country’s development. Facing an extremely complex environment both at home and abroad, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has rallied and led the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to forge ahead. We have moved forward with the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-pronged Comprehensive Strategy, and made new advances on all fronts of reform, opening-up, and socialist modernization.<br/>At its 19th National Congress, the Party established the position in history of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and mapped out an inspiring blueprint and a program of action for securing a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and for striving for the success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era. This is of great immediate significance and far-reaching historical significance.<br/>All regions and all government departments have strengthened their consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment. The new development philosophy has been thoroughly acted upon, the 12th Five-Year Plan has been fully completed, and implementation of the 13th Five-Year Plan has seen smooth progress. In economic and social development we have made historic achievements and seen historic change.

五年来，经济实力跃上新台阶。国内生产总值从54万亿元增加到82.7万亿元，年均增长7.1%，占世界经济比重从11.4%提高到15%左右，对世界经济增长贡献率超过30%。财政收入从11.7万亿元增加到17.3万亿元。居民消费价格年均上涨1.9%，保持较低水平。城镇新增就业6600万人以上，13亿多人口的大国实现了比较充分就业。<br/>Over the past five years, economic strength has reached a new high.<br/>China’s gross domestic product (GDP) has risen from 54 trillion to 82.7 trillion yuan, registering average annual growth of 7.1 percent; and its share in the global economy has grown to roughly 15 percent, up from 11.4 percent. China’s contribution to global growth has exceeded 30 percent. Government revenue has increased from 11.7 trillion to 17.3 trillion yuan. Consumer prices rose at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent, maintaining a relatively low level of growth. More than 66 million new urban jobs have been added, and our country, with its population of over 1.3 billion, has achieved relatively full employment.

五年来，经济结构出现重大变革。消费贡献率由54.9%提高到58.8%，服务业比重从45.3%上升到51.6%，成为经济增长主动力。高技术制造业年均增长11.7%。粮食生产能力达到1.2万亿斤。城镇化率从52.6%提高到58.5%，8000多万农业转移人口成为城镇居民。<br/>Over the past five years, the structure of the Chinese economy has seen a major transformation.<br/>With the share of the service sector rising from 45.3 to 51.6 percent of the economy, consumption’s contribution to growth has increased from 54.9 to 58.8 percent, becoming the main driver of growth. High-tech manufacturing has achieved an average annual increase of 11.7 percent, and the annual grain yield has reached 600 million metric tons. China’s urbanization rate has risen from 52.6 to 58.5 percent, and more than 80 million people who have relocated from rural to urban areas have gained permanent urban residency.

五年来，创新驱动发展成果丰硕。全社会研发投入年均增长11%，规模跃居世界第二位。科技进步贡献率由52.2%提高到57.5%。载人航天、深海探测、量子通信、大飞机等重大创新成果不断涌现。高铁网络、电子商务、移动支付、共享经济等引领世界潮流。“互联网+”广泛融入各行各业。大众创业、万众创新蓬勃发展，日均新设企业由5千多户增加到1万6千多户。快速崛起的新动能，正在重塑经济增长格局、深刻改变生产生活方式，成为中国创新发展的新标志。<br/>Over the past five years, innovation-driven development has yielded fruitful outcomes.<br/>China’s investment in research and development (R&D) has grown at an average annual rate of 11 percent, ranking second in the world in scale. The contribution of technological advances to economic growth has risen from 52.2 to 57.5 percent. In manned spaceflight, deep-water exploration, quantum communications, large aircraft development, and more, China has seen a stream of major outcomes of innovation. In high-speed rail, e-commerce, mobile payments, and the sharing economy, China is leading the world.<br/>The Internet Plus model has permeated every industry and every field. Business startups and innovation are thriving all over the country, and the average number of new businesses opened daily has risen from over 5,000 to more than 16,000. Rapidly emerging new growth drivers are reshaping China’s growth model, are profoundly changing the way we live and work, and have become a new hallmark of China’s innovation-driven development.

五年来，改革开放迈出重大步伐。改革全面发力、多点突破、纵深推进，重要领域和关键环节改革取得突破性进展。简政放权、放管结合、优化服务等改革推动政府职能发生深刻转变，市场活力和社会创造力明显增强。“一带一路”建设成效显著，对外贸易和利用外资结构优化、规模稳居世界前列。<br/>Over the past five years, significant headway has been made in reform and opening-up.
In reform, we have made strong moves across the board, secured major advances in many areas, and driven deeper in pursuing progress, making breakthroughs in reforms in important fields and key links. Reforms to streamline administration and delegate powers, improve regulation, and optimize services, have driven profound shifts in the functions of government, and significantly strengthened market dynamism and public creativity. The Belt and Road Initiative has been making major progress. The composition of both Chinese foreign trade and foreign investment in China has been improved, with volumes ranking among the largest in the world.

五年来，人民生活持续改善。脱贫攻坚取得决定性进展，贫困人口减少6800多万，易地扶贫搬迁830万人，贫困发生率由10.2%下降到3.1%。居民收入年均增长7.4%、超过经济增速，形成世界上人口最多的中等收入群体。出境旅游人次由8300万增加到1亿3千多万。社会养老保险覆盖9亿多人，基本医疗保险覆盖13.5亿人，织就了世界上最大的社会保障网。人均预期寿命达到76.7岁。棚户区住房改造2600多万套，农村危房改造1700多万户，上亿人喜迁新居。<br/>Over the past five years, living standards have been constantly improving.<br/>We have made decisive progress in the fight against poverty: More than 68 million people have been lifted out of poverty, including a total of 8.3 million relocated from inhospitable areas, and the poverty headcount ratio has dropped from 10.2 to 3.1 percent. Personal income has increased by an annual average of 7.4 percent, outpacing economic growth and creating the world’s largest middle-income group. Tourist departures have grown from 83 million to over 130 million. Social old-age pension schemes now cover more than 900 million people, and the basic health insurance plans cover 1.35 billion people, forming the largest social safety net in the world. On average, life expectancy has reached 76.7 years. Over 26 million housing units have been rebuilt in rundown urban areas, and more than 17 million dilapidated houses have been renovated in rural areas. Thanks to these efforts, more than one hundred million Chinese have moved into new homes.

五年来，生态环境状况逐步好转。制定实施大气、水、土壤污染防治三个“十条”并取得扎实成效。单位国内生产总值能耗、水耗均下降20%以上，主要污染物排放量持续下降，重点城市重污染天数减少一半，森林面积增加1.63亿亩，沙化土地面积年均缩减近2000平方公里，绿色发展呈现可喜局面。<br/>Over the past five years, the environment has seen gradual improvement.<br/>To address air, water, and soil pollution, we have designed and enforced a ten-point list of measures for each and achieved solid progress. Both energy and water consumption per unit of GDP have fallen more than 20 percent, the release of major pollutants has been consistently declining, and the number of days of heavy air pollution in key cities has fallen 50 percent. Forest coverage has increased by 10.87 million hectares, and the area of desertified land has been reduced by close to 2,000 square kilometers on average each year. Encouraging progress has been made in green development.

刚刚过去的2017年，经济社会发展主要目标任务全面完成并好于预期。国内生产总值增长6.9%，居民收入增长7.3%，增速均比上年有所加快；城镇新增就业1351万人，失业率为多年来最低；工业增速回升，企业利润增长21%；财政收入增长7.4%，扭转了增速放缓态势；进出口增长14.2%，实际使用外资1363亿美元、创历史新高。经济发展呈现出增长与质量、结构、效益相得益彰的良好局面。这是五年来一系列重大政策效应累积，各方面不懈努力、久久为功的结果。<br/>In the year just passed, all main targets and tasks for economic and social development were accomplished and performance has exceeded expectations. GDP grew 6.9 percent and personal income rose 7.3 percent, both beating the previous year’s growth rates. Around 13.51 million new urban jobs were created, and the jobless rate was the lowest in recent years. Industrial growth began to rebound, and corporate profits increased 21 percent. Government revenue grew 7.4 percent, reversing the slowdown in growth. The total import and export value rose 14.2 percent. Inward foreign investment reached 136.3 billion U.S. dollars, hitting a new all-time high.<br/>The state of play in the economy was good, with growth and quality, structural improvement, and performance each reinforcing the other. This is the result of the cumulative effect of a raft of major policies over the past five years and of consistent efforts in all areas of endeavor.

过去五年取得的全方位、开创性成就，发生的深层次、根本性变革，再次令世界瞩目，全国各族人民倍感振奋和自豪。<br/>Over the past five years, the ground-breaking achievements made on every front and the profound and fundamental changes that have taken place, have attracted global attention and are the pride and inspiration of all of us in China.

五年来，我们认真贯彻以习近平同志为核心的党中央决策部署，主要做了以下工作。<br/>Over the past five years, we have worked with dedication to implement the decisions and plans made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core. The following are the highlights of that work:

**（一）坚持稳中求进工作总基调，着力创新和完善宏观调控，经济运行保持在合理区间、实现稳中向好。**<br/>**First, with a commitment to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, we have focused on developing new and better approaches to macro regulation, kept major indicators within an appropriate range, and achieved stable, positive economic performance.**

这些年，世界经济复苏乏力，国际金融市场跌宕起伏，保护主义明显抬头。我国经济发展中结构性问题和深层次矛盾凸显，经济下行压力持续加大，遇到不少两难多难抉择。面对这种局面，我们保持战略定力，坚持不搞“大水漫灌”式强刺激，而是适应把握引领经济发展新常态，统筹稳增长、促改革、调结构、惠民生、防风险，不断创新和完善宏观调控，确立区间调控的思路和方式，加强定向调控、相机调控、精准调控。明确强调只要经济运行在合理区间，就业增加、收入增长、环境改善，就集中精力促改革、调结构、添动力。采取既利当前更惠长远的举措，着力推进供给侧结构性改革，适度扩大总需求，推动实现更高层次的供需动态平衡。经过艰辛努力，我们顶住了经济下行压力、避免了“硬着陆”，保持了经济中高速增长，促进了结构优化，经济长期向好的基本面不断巩固和发展。<br/>The past few years have witnessed anemic world economic recovery, volatility in global financial markets, and a sharp rise in protectionism. In China, structural issues and underlying problems have become more acute, downward pressure on the economy has continued to mount, and we have met with no small number of dilemmas.<br/>In confronting this new environment, we have maintained strategic focus and refrained from resorting to a deluge of strong stimulus policies. Instead, we have adapted to, addressed, and steered the new normal in economic development, and taken coordinated steps to ensure steady growth, advance reform, make structural adjustments, improve living standards, and guard against risk. We have made fresh innovations in and refined macro regulation, developed the idea of and ways to achieve ranged-based regulation, and enhanced targeted, well-timed, and precision regulation.
We have been clear that as long as the major economic indicators are within an acceptable range, with employment growing, incomes increasing, and the environment improving, then our energies should be focused on advancing reform, making structural adjustments, and adding growth drivers.<br/>We have adopted measures that are good for the near term and even better for the long term, made strong moves to advance supply-side structural reform, appropriately expanded aggregate demand, and worked for a dynamic equilibrium of supply and demand at a higher level.<br/>With grit and determination, we have overcome downward pressure on the economy, avoided a “hard landing,” maintained a medium-high growth rate, and promoted structural upgrading. The economic fundamentals that will sustain long-term growth have been cemented and enhanced.

坚持实施积极的财政政策和稳健的货币政策。在财政收支矛盾较大情况下，着眼“放水养鱼”、增强后劲，我国率先大幅减税降费。分步骤全面推开营改增，结束了66年的营业税征收历史，累计减税超过2万亿元，加上采取小微企业税收优惠、清理各种收费等措施，共减轻市场主体负担3万多亿元。加强地方政府债务管理，实施地方政府存量债务置换，降低利息负担1.2万亿元。调整财政支出结构，盘活沉淀资金，保障基本民生和重点项目。财政赤字率一直控制在3%以内。货币政策保持稳健中性，广义货币M2增速呈下降趋势，信贷和社会融资规模适度增长。采取定向降准、专项再贷款等差别化政策，加强对重点领域和薄弱环节支持，小微企业贷款增速高于各项贷款平均增速。改革完善汇率市场化形成机制，保持人民币汇率基本稳定，外汇储备转降为升。妥善应对“钱荒”等金融市场异常波动，规范金融市场秩序，防范化解重点领域风险，守住了不发生系统性风险的底线，维护了国家经济金融安全。<br/>We have continued to follow a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy. Despite a fairly big imbalance between government revenue and expenditure, China has led the way in slashing taxes and fees with the aim of using accommodative measures to strengthen the basis for sustained growth. Step by step, we have extended the replacement of business tax with value added tax (VAT) to all sectors across the country, calling time on the 66-year history of business tax. The result so far has been a tax cut of more than 2 trillion yuan. We have also adopted measures like preferential tax policies for small low-profit businesses and an overhaul of different types of fees. All in all, our market entities have seen savings of more than 3 trillion yuan. We have strengthened management over local government debt, and issued local government bonds to replace outstanding debt, cutting interest liability by 1.2 trillion yuan. We have adjusted the structure of government expenditure, put idle funds to work, and ensured the spending for undertaking major projects and meeting basic public needs. The deficit-to-GDP ratio has been kept within 3 percent.<br/>Monetary policy has remained prudent and neutral. The M2 money supply growth rate has been trending downward, while credit and aggregate financing have seen moderate growth. Differentiated policies, such as targeted reserve requirement ratio cuts and targeted re-lending, have been adopted to strengthen support for key fields and weak links. The growth of loans to small and micro businesses has outstripped the average growth in lending. We have reformed and improved the market-based exchange rate mechanism and kept the RMB exchange rate basically stable; and foreign exchange reserves are now rising not falling. We have responded appropriately to abnormal market fluctuations such as the cash crunch, brought better order to the financial markets, prevented and diffused risks in key sectors, forestalled systemic risks, and thus safeguarded China’s economic and financial security.

**（二）坚持以供给侧结构性改革为主线，着力培育壮大新动能，经济结构加快优化升级。**紧紧依靠改革破解经济发展和结构失衡难题，大力发展新兴产业，改造提升传统产业，提高供给体系质量和效率。<br/>**Second, with a commitment to treating supply-side structural reform as our main task, we have focused on fostering new growth drivers to speed up economic structural upgrading.**<br/>We have persevered in relying on reform to overcome economic difficulties and address structural imbalances, made a big push to foster emerging industries, overhauled and strengthened traditional industries, and improved the quality and performance of the supply system.

扎实推进“三去一降一补”。五年来，在淘汰水泥、平板玻璃等落后产能基础上，以钢铁、煤炭等行业为重点加大去产能力度，中央财政安排1000亿元专项奖补资金予以支持，用于分流职工安置。退出钢铁产能1.7亿吨以上、煤炭产能8亿吨，安置分流职工110多万人。因城施策分类指导，三四线城市商品住宅去库存取得明显成效，热点城市房价涨势得到控制。积极稳妥去杠杆，控制债务规模，增加股权融资，工业企业资产负债率连续下降，宏观杠杆率涨幅明显收窄、总体趋于稳定。多措并举降成本，压减政府性基金项目30%，削减中央政府层面设立的涉企收费项目60%以上，阶段性降低“五险一金”缴费比例，推动降低用能、物流、电信等成本。突出重点加大补短板力度。<br/>Solid work has moved us forward in the five priority tasks of cutting overcapacity, reducing excess inventory, deleveraging, lowering costs, and strengthening areas of weakness.<br/>Over the past five years, building on work to cut backward production capacity in the cement, plate glass, and other industries, we have intensified efforts to cut overcapacity, prioritizing industries such as steel and coal; and a 100-billion-yuan fund for rewards and subsidies has been put in place by the central government to support efforts to assist affected employees. We have cut steel production capacity by more than 170 million metric tons and coal production capacity by 800 million metric tons, and over 1.1 million affected employees have been assisted.<br/>Thanks to city-specific policies and category-specific guidance, clear progress has been made in reducing commercial residential housing inventory in third- and fourth-tier cities, and the growth of housing prices in the most popular cities has been brought under control.
We have taken active and prudent steps to deleverage, control the scale of debts, and expand equity finance. The debt-to-asset ratio of industrial enterprises has been consistently declining. Macro leverage ratio is increasing by much smaller margins and is generally stable.<br/>We have used a combination of measures to bring down costs: 30 percent of government-managed funds and fees have been cut; over 60 percent of the fees and charges levied on businesses by the central government have been abolished; the ratio of enterprise contributions to old-age pension, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and maternity insurance, workers’ compensation, and housing provident fund schemes has been reduced for the time being, and work has been done to lower energy, logistics, and telecommunications costs.<br/>We have stepped up efforts to strengthen areas of weakness, with a focus on key issues.

加快新旧发展动能接续转换。深入开展“互联网+”行动，实行包容审慎监管，推动大数据、云计算、物联网广泛应用，新兴产业蓬勃发展，传统产业深刻重塑。实施“中国制造2025”，推进工业强基、智能制造、绿色制造等重大工程，先进制造业加快发展。出台现代服务业改革发展举措，服务新业态新模式异军突起，促进了各行业融合升级。深化农业供给侧结构性改革，新型经营主体大批涌现，种植业适度规模经营比重从30%提升到40%以上。采取措施增加中低收入者收入，推动传统消费提档升级、新兴消费快速兴起，网上零售额年均增长30%以上，社会消费品零售总额年均增长11.3%。优化投资结构，鼓励民间投资，发挥政府投资撬动作用，引导更多资金投向强基础、增后劲、惠民生领域。高速铁路运营里程从9000多公里增加到2万5千公里、占世界三分之二，高速公路里程从9.6万公里增加到13.6万公里，新建改建农村公路127万公里，新建民航机场46个，开工重大水利工程122项，完成新一轮农村电网改造，建成全球最大的移动宽带网。五年来，发展新动能迅速壮大，经济增长实现由主要依靠投资、出口拉动转向依靠消费、投资、出口协同拉动，由主要依靠第二产业带动转向依靠三次产业共同带动。这是我们多年想实现而没有实现的重大结构性变革。<br/>We have sped up the replacement of old growth drivers.<br/>We have done more in carrying out the Internet Plus Initiative, exercised accommodative and prudential regulation, and promoted the extensive application of big data, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things; emerging industries have achieved vigorous growth, and traditional industries have undergone a thorough remodeling.<br/>Implementation of the Made in China 2025 Initiative has brought progress in major projects like the building of robust industrial foundations, smart manufacturing, and green manufacturing, and has accelerated the development of advanced manufacturing.<br/>We unveiled reform and development measures to foster modern services; and this has led to a marked rise in new forms of business in the services sector and new service models as well as the integration and upgrading of multiple sectors.<br/>Deepened supply-side structural reform in agriculture has brought the emergence of a large number of new types of agribusiness. The share of appropriately scaled-up farming has increased from 30 to over 40 percent.<br/>We have taken measures to increase the incomes of those in low- and middle-income brackets, and helped to see an upgrading of traditional forms of consumption, and a boom in new forms of consumption. Online retail sales have been growing at an average annual rate of over 30 percent, and total retail sales of consumer goods have enjoyed an average annual increase of 11.3 percent.<br/>We have improved the composition of investment, encouraged private investment, used government investment to play a catalytic role, and guided more funding toward areas that strengthen the economic foundation, enhance sustainability, and improve people’s lives.<br/>China’s in-operation high-speed railways have grown from over 9,000 to 25,000 kilometers, accounting for two thirds of the world’s total. Our expressways have grown from 96,000 to 136,000 kilometers. We have built or upgraded 1.27 million kilometers of rural roads, built 46 new civilian airports, and begun work on 122 major water conservancy projects. We have completed the latest round of rural power grid upgrading, and put in place the largest mobile broadband network in the world.<br/>Over the past five years, new growth drivers have rapidly grown in strength. Economic growth, in the past mainly driven by investment and exports, is now being fueled by consumption, investment, and exports. In the past dependent mainly on secondary industry, growth is now powered by a combination of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. This is a major structural transformation that for years our sights have been set on, but we were always unable to achieve.

推进供给侧结构性改革，必须破除要素市场化配置障碍，降低制度性交易成本。针对长期存在的重审批、轻监管、弱服务问题，我们持续深化“放管服”改革，加快转变政府职能，减少微观管理、直接干预，注重加强宏观调控、市场监管和公共服务。五年来，国务院部门行政审批事项削减44%，非行政许可审批彻底终结，中央政府层面核准的企业投资项目减少90%，行政审批中介服务事项压减74%，职业资格许可和认定大幅减少。中央政府定价项目缩减80%，地方政府定价项目缩减50%以上。全面改革工商登记、注册资本等商事制度，企业开办时间缩短三分之一以上。创新和加强事中事后监管，实行“双随机、一公开”，随机抽取检查人员和检查对象、及时公开查处结果，提高了监管效能和公正性。推行“互联网+政务服务”，实施一站式服务等举措。营商环境持续改善，市场活力明显增强，群众办事更加便利。<br/>Advancing supply-side structural reform demands removing barriers to market based allocation of the factors of production and reducing government-imposed transaction costs.
To address the longstanding issues of excessive emphasis on approval procedures, insufficient attention to regulatory processes, and a failure to provide strong services, we have been consistently deepening reforms to streamline administration, delegate powers, improve regulation, and strengthen services.<br/>We have sped up efforts to transform government functions, reduced micromanagement and direct intervention, and done more to improve macro regulation, market regulation, and public services.
Over the past five years, the number of items subject to approval by State Council offices and departments has been slashed by 44 percent, the practice of non-administrative approval has been completely put to a stop, the number of business investment items subject to central government approval has been cut by 90 percent, intermediary services needed for obtaining government approval have been cut by 74 percent, and the requirements for professional qualification approval and accreditation have been significantly reduced. The number of items for which central government sets the prices has been cut back by 80 percent, and local government-priced items have been cut down by over 50 percent. Comprehensive reforms have swept the business system, including business and capital registration, reducing the time it takes to start a business by over a third.<br/>We have developed new and better ways of conducting compliance oversight, and introduced a new model of oversight combining randomly selected inspectors who inspect randomly selected entities and the prompt release of results. These efforts have made regulation more effective and impartial.<br/>We have rolled out the Internet Plus Government Services model and adopted measures such as the one-stop service model.<br/>Thanks to the above reforms, the business environment has consistently improved, the market is more energized, and people can access government services more easily.

**（三）坚持创新引领发展，着力激发社会创造力，整体创新能力和效率显著提高。**实施创新驱动发展战略，优化创新生态，形成多主体协同、全方位推进的创新局面。扩大科研机构和高校科研自主权，改进科研项目和经费管理，深化科技成果权益管理改革。支持北京、上海建设科技创新中心，新设14个国家自主创新示范区，带动形成一批区域创新高地。以企业为主体加强技术创新体系建设，涌现一批具有国际竞争力的创新型企业和新型研发机构。深入开展大众创业、万众创新，实施普惠性支持政策，完善孵化体系。各类市场主体达到9800多万户，五年增加70%以上。国内有效发明专利拥有量增加两倍，技术交易额翻了一番。我国科技创新由跟跑为主转向更多领域并跑、领跑，成为全球瞩目的创新创业热土。<br/>**Third, with a commitment to innovation-driven development, and a focus on unlocking public creativity, we have achieved a remarkable improvement in our general capacity for making innovations and for seeing that innovation delivers.**<br/>We have put into action the innovation-driven development strategy and worked to build a better ecosystem for innovation, giving shape to innovation involving multiple actors making across-the-board advances.<br/>Research institutes and universities now have greater say over their research; research projects and funding are better managed, and the way of managing rights and interests relating to scientific and technological advances has undergone reform.<br/>We have supported Beijing and Shanghai in building themselves into centers for scientific and technological innovation, and set up 14 new national innovation demonstration zones, thus creating a number of regional innovation hubs.<br/>With enterprises as the main actors, we have boosted the development of a system for technological innovation. China has seen the emergence of a number of world-class innovative enterprises and new-type R&D institutions.<br/>We have launched and taken bold moves in the nationwide business startup and innovation initiative, adopted support policies designed to benefit all entrepreneurs and innovators, and improved the incubation system.<br/>China’s market entities, all types included, now total over 98 million, an increase of more than 70 percent over the past five years. The number of in-force Chinese invention patents issued in China has tripled, and the volume of technology transactions has doubled.

各位代表！<br/>Fellow Deputies,

回顾过去五年，诸多矛盾交织叠加，各种风险挑战接踵而至，国内外很多情况是改革开放以来没有碰到过的，我国改革发展成就实属来之不易。这是以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导的结果，是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想科学指引的结果，是全党全军全国各族人民团结奋斗的结果。我代表国务院，向全国各族人民，向各民主党派、各人民团体和各界人士，表示诚挚感谢！向香港特别行政区同胞、澳门特别行政区同胞、台湾同胞和海外侨胞，表示诚挚感谢！向关心和支持中国现代化建设的各国政府、国际组织和各国朋友，表示诚挚感谢！<br/>Looking back at the past five years, we have encountered a great many interwoven problems and a stream of risks and challenges. Both at home and abroad, there have been many new developments, developments that we have not faced since reform and opening-up began. The achievements we have made in China’s reform and development have certainly not come easily. We owe them to the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, to the sound guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and to the concerted efforts of the Party, the military, and the people of all our nation’s ethnic groups.<br/>On behalf of the State Council, I wish to express sincere thanks to the people of all our ethnic groups, and to all other political parties, people’s organizations, and public figures from all sectors of society. I express our sincere appreciation to our fellow countrymen and women in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, in Taiwan, and overseas. I also wish to express our sincere thanks to the governments of other countries, international organizations, and friends from all over the world who have shown understanding and support for China in its endeavor to modernize.

安不忘危，兴不忘忧。我们清醒认识到，我国仍处于并将长期处于社会主义初级阶段，仍是世界最大发展中国家，发展不平衡不充分的一些突出问题尚未解决。经济增长内生动力还不够足，创新能力还不够强，发展质量和效益不够高，一些企业特别是中小企业经营困难，民间投资增势疲弱，部分地区经济下行压力较大，金融等领域风险隐患不容忽视。脱贫攻坚任务艰巨，农业基础仍然薄弱，城乡区域发展和收入分配差距依然较大。重特大安全生产事故时有发生。在空气质量、环境卫生、食品药品安全和住房、教育、医疗、就业、养老等方面，群众还有不少不满意的地方。政府职能转变还不到位。政府工作存在不足，有些改革举措和政策落实不力，一些干部服务意识和法治意识不强、工作作风不实、担当精神不够，形式主义、官僚主义不同程度存在。群众和企业对办事难、乱收费意见较多。一些领域不正之风和腐败问题仍然多发。我们一定要以对国家和人民高度负责的精神，以不畏艰难的勇气、坚忍不拔的意志，尽心竭力做好工作，使人民政府不负人民重托！<br/>As the Chinese saying goes, when all is calm, forget not danger; when all is well, be awake to woes. We are keenly aware that China is still in the primary stage of socialism and will remain so for a long time to come, that it remains the largest developing country in the world, and that it faces a number of acute problems caused by unbalanced and inadequate development that so far have remained unsolved.<br/>The internal forces powering economic growth are not yet sufficient, China’s ability to innovate needs to be stronger, and the quality and performance of development need to be improved. Some enterprises, particularly small and medium ones, are finding it tough going. Growth in private investment is weak; some regions still face considerable downward economic pressure, and risks and potential dangers in the financial and other sectors are not to be ignored.<br/>Poverty alleviation remains a formidable task; agriculture is not based on a strong foundation. The disparities in development between rural and urban areas, between regions, and in income distribution remain substantial. Serious and major workplace accidents happen all too often. People still have a lot of complaints about air quality, environmental sanitation, food and drug safety, housing, education, healthcare, employment, and elderly care.<br/>The transformation of government functions has not yet reached where it should be. In government work there are places where we fall short. Some reform measures and policies have not been fully implemented. Some officials are weak on awareness that they are there to serve and must uphold the rule of law, and some lack commitment to their work and willingness to bear the weight of responsibility. Bureaucratism and the practice of formalities for formalities’ sake exist to varying degrees. There are many complaints from the people and the business sector about the difficulty of accessing government services and the excessive array of charges. In some sectors misconduct and corruption are still a common problem.
With a deep sense of responsibility to our country and people, with courage in the face of adversity, and with determination that won’t be broken, we must give our work everything we’ve got, to make sure that the people’s government does not let the people down.

综合分析国内外形势，我国发展面临的机遇和挑战并存。世界经济有望继续复苏，但不稳定不确定因素很多，主要经济体政策调整及其外溢效应带来变数，保护主义加剧，地缘政治风险上升。我国经济正处在转变发展方式、优化经济结构、转换增长动力的攻关期，还有很多坡要爬、坎要过，需要应对可以预料和难以预料的风险挑战。实践表明，中国的发展成就从来都是在攻坚克难中取得的。当前我国物质技术基础更加雄厚，产业体系完备、市场规模巨大、人力资源丰富、创业创新活跃，综合优势明显，有能力有条件实现更高质量、更有效率、更加公平、更可持续的发展。<br/>A comprehensive analysis of how things stand at home and abroad tells us that China, in its development, faces both opportunities and challenges. We can expect continued recovery of the global economy, but there are also many factors that bring instability and uncertainty. The policy changes of the major economies and their spillover effects create uncertainty; protectionism is mounting, and geopolitical risks are on the ascent. China’s economy is now in a pivotal period in the transformation of its growth model, its structural improvement, and its shift to new growth drivers. There are still many hills to climb and gorges to cross; we will have to face risks and challenges, some foreseeable and others not. In fact, it’s always been the case that China’s achievements in development have been made whilst overcoming difficulties. Today, China’s material and technological foundations are much stronger; its industrial system is complete, its market is vast, its human resources are abundant, and its entrepreneurs and innovators are dynamic. We enjoy composite advantages, and all this means that we have the ability and the conditions to achieve higher quality, more efficient, fairer, and more sustainable development.

今年发展主要预期目标是：国内生产总值增长 6.5%左右；居民消费价格涨幅 3%左右；城镇新增就业 1100万人以上，城镇调查失业率 5.5%以内，城镇登记失业率 4.5%以内；居民收入增长和经济增长基本同步；进出口稳中向好，国际收支基本平衡；单位国内生产总值能耗下降 3%以上，主要污染物排放量继续下降；供给侧结构性改革取得实质性进展，宏观杠杆率保持基本稳定，各类风险有序有效防控。<br/>Based on the above considerations, we have set the following projected targets for development this year:<br/>• GDP growth of around 6.5 percent<br/>• CPI increase of around 3 percent<br/>• Over 11 million new urban jobs, the surveyed urban unemployment rate within 5.5 percent, and the registered urban jobless rate within 4.5 percent<br/>• Basic parity in personal income growth and economic growth<br/>• A steady rise in import and export volumes, and a basic equilibrium in the balance of payments<br/>• A drop of at least 3 percent in energy consumption per unit of GDP, and continued reductions in the release of major pollutants<br/>• Substantive progress in supply-side structural reform, basically stable macro leverage, and systematic and effective prevention and control of risk

上述主要预期目标，考虑了决胜全面建成小康社会需要，符合我国经济已由高速增长阶段转向高质量发展阶段实际。从经济基本面和就业吸纳能力看，6.5%左右的增速可以实现比较充分的就业。城镇调查失业率涵盖农民工等城镇常住人口，今年首次把这一指标作为预期目标，以更全面反映就业状况，更好体现共享发展要求。<br/>The above targets take into consideration the need to secure a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and are fitting given the fact that China’s economy is transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development. Given our economic fundamentals and capacity for job creation, GDP growth of around 6.5 percent will enable us to achieve relatively full employment. The surveyed urban unemployment rate covers rural migrant workers and other permanent urban residents. This year, for the first time we are using this indicator as a projected target; this is intended to give a fuller picture of employment and to better reflect the requirement that development that is to be shared by everyone.

今年要继续创新和完善宏观调控，把握好宏观调控的度，保持宏观政策连续性稳定性，加强财政、货币、产业、区域等政策协调配合。<br/>This year, we will continue to develop new ways of improving macro regulation and ensure that the degree of macro regulation is right. We will maintain the continuity and consistency of macro policies, and better coordinate fiscal, monetary, industrial, regional, and other policies.

积极的财政政策取向不变，要聚力增效。今年赤字率拟按 2.6%安排，比去年预算低 0.4个百分点；财政赤字 2.38万亿元，其中中央财政赤字 1.55万亿元，地方财政赤字 8300亿元。调低赤字率，主要是我国经济稳中向好、财政增收有基础，也为宏观调控留下更多政策空间。今年全国财政支出 21万亿元，支出规模进一步加大。中央对地方一般性转移支付增长 10.9%，增强地方特别是中西部地区财力。优化财政支出结构，提高财政支出的公共性、普惠性，加大对三大攻坚战的支持，更多向创新驱动、“三农”、民生等领域倾斜。当前财政状况出现好转，各级政府仍要坚持过紧日子，执守简朴、力戒浮华，严控一般性支出，把宝贵的资金更多用于为发展增添后劲、为民生雪中送炭。<br/>The proactive direction of our fiscal policy will remain the same, and we will concentrate efforts to increase efficiency. This year’s deficit as a percentage of GDP is projected to be 2.6 percent, 0.4 percentage point lower than last year. The government deficit is projected to be 2.38 trillion yuan, with a central government deficit of 1.55 trillion yuan and local government deficit of 0.83 trillion yuan. The reduction in the deficit-to-GDP ratio is mainly due to China’s economic growth being steady and the foundation being there for an increase in revenue; it also keeps policy options open for macro regulation. Government expenditure is budgeted at 21 trillion yuan, representing a further increase in the scale of spending. The central government will increase general transfer payments to local governments by 10.9 percent, to strengthen local finances, especially in the central and western regions. We will improve the structure of budgetary spending, making sure that more financial allocations are used for the public good and universal benefit, increasing support for the three critical battles against potential risk, poverty, and pollution, and weighting spending toward innovation-driven development, agriculture, rural areas, and rural residents, and the improvement of living standards. Although the government finances are improving, government at all levels must keep its belt tightened, keep things as simple as possible, abstain from all excess, and strictly control general expenditures, so that these precious funds are used to add growth drivers for sustaining development and meet people’s most urgent needs.

稳健的货币政策保持中性，要松紧适度。管好货币供给总闸门，保持广义货币 M2、信贷和社会融资规模合理增长，维护流动性合理稳定，提高直接融资特别是股权融资比重。疏通货币政策传导渠道，用好差别化准备金、差异化信贷等政策，引导资金更多投向小微企业、“三农”和贫困地区，更好服务实体经济。<br/>Our prudent monetary policy will remain neutral, with easing or tightening only as appropriate. We need to make sure that the valve of aggregate monetary supply is well controlled, maintain moderate growth in M2 money supply, credit, and aggregate financing, ensure a reasonable, stable level of liquidity, and increase the proportion of direct finance, particularly equity finance. We will improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, make better use of differentiated reserve ratio and credit policies, and encourage more funds to flow toward small and micro businesses, agriculture, rural areas, and rural residents, and poor areas, and to better serve the real economy.

做好今年工作，要认真贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义经济思想，坚持稳中求进工作总基调，把稳和进作为一个整体来把握，注重以下几点。一是大力推动高质量发展。发展是解决我国一切问题的基础和关键。要着力解决发展不平衡不充分问题，围绕建设现代化经济体系，坚持质量第一、效益优先，促进经济结构优化升级。要尊重经济规律，远近结合，确保经济运行在合理区间，实现经济平稳增长和质量效益提高互促共进。二是加大改革开放力度。改革开放是决定当代中国命运的关键一招，也是实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标的关键一招。在新的历史起点上，思想要再解放，改革要再深化，开放要再扩大。充分发挥人民首创精神，鼓励各地从实际出发，敢闯敢试，敢于碰硬，把改革开放不断向前推进。三是抓好决胜全面建成小康社会三大攻坚战。要分别提出工作思路和具体举措，排出时间表、路线图、优先序，确保风险隐患得到有效控制，确保脱贫攻坚任务全面完成，确保生态环境质量总体改善。我们所做的一切工作，都是为了人民。要坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，从我国基本国情出发，尽力而为、量力而行，把群众最关切最烦心的事一件一件解决好，促进社会公平正义和人的全面发展，使人民生活随着国家发展一年比一年更好。<br/>For government to deliver this year, we must act on Xi Jinping’s economic thinking for new-era socialism with Chinese characteristics, continue following the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, and regard stability and progress as being indivisible. Specifically, we will do the following:<br/>First, we will strongly promote high-quality development. Development is the underpinning and the key for solving all our country’s problems. We will devote attention to addressing unbalanced and insufficient development. Centering on developing a modernized economy, we will put quality first and give priority to performance, and promote economic structural improvement and upgrading. We must respect objective economic laws, consider both long- and near-term needs, ensure the economy performs within a reasonable range, and achieve a situation in which steady economic growth and improvement in quality and performance reinforce each other.<br/>Second, we will be bolder in reform and opening-up. Reform and opening was a game-changing move in making China what it is today; it now remains a game-changing move for us to achieve China’s Two Centenary Goals*. Standing at a new historic starting point, we must go further in freeing our minds, in deepening reform, and in opening-up. We need to give full play to the pioneering drive of the people, and encourage all localities, based on their own conditions, to dare to explore, dare to try things out, and dare to confront the toughest of issues, to keep reform and opening-up constantly moving forward.<br/>Third, we will ensure success in the three critical battles against potential risk, poverty, and pollution, battles that are important for decisively bringing to completion the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects. We need to adopt targeted approaches and specific measures, draw up timetables and roadmaps, and set well-defined priorities. We will make sure risks and potential dangers are effectively controlled, make sure poverty alleviation is fully accomplished, and make sure there is an overall improvement in the quality of the environment. All of our work is work for the people. We will stay true to the vision of people-centered development, start by considering China’s own situation, and do everything within our capacity to resolve each and every one of the issues that most affect and worry our people, promote social fairness and justice and well-rounded human development, and see that the people’s lives, along with our country’s development, keep getting better year after year.

**三、对 2018年政府工作的建议**
**Fellow Deputies,**<br/>**Let me turn to what we propose for the work of government in 2018.**

今年经济社会发展任务十分繁重。要紧紧抓住大有可为的历史机遇期，统筹兼顾、突出重点，扎实做好各项工作。<br/>The tasks of economic and social development this year are formidable. We will make the most of this period of historic opportunity-a period for making things happen. We will take coordinated action that covers all sectors and focus on clear priorities, to deliver a solid performance in all areas of work.

**（一）深入推进供给侧结构性改革。**坚持把发展经济着力点放在实体经济上，继续抓好“三去一降一补”，大力简政减税减费，不断优化营商环境，进一步激发市场主体活力，提升经济发展质量。<br/>**1. Stepping up supply-side structural reform.** In economic development we need to focus on the real economy. We will continue to cut overcapacity, reduce excess inventory, deleverage, lower costs, and strengthen areas of weakness. We will take big steps to streamline administration and cut taxes and fees, keep improving the business environment, and further energize market entities, to increase the quality of economic growth.

发展壮大新动能。做大做强新兴产业集群，实施大数据发展行动，加强新一代人工智能研发应用，在医疗、养老、教育、文化、体育等多领域推进“互联网+”。发展智能产业，拓展智能生活。运用新技术、新业态、新模式，大力改造提升传统产业。加强新兴产业统计。加大网络提速降费力度，实现高速宽带城乡全覆盖，扩大公共场所免费上网范围，明显降低家庭宽带、企业宽带和专线使用费，取消流量“漫游”费，移动网络流量资费年内至少降低 30%，让群众和企业切实受益，为数字中国建设加油助力。<br/>We will develop powerful new growth drivers. We will create big, strong industrial clusters in emerging industries, implement the big data development action plan, step up next-generation artificial intelligence R&D and application, and do more to promote the Internet Plus model in many fields like medical care, eldercare, education, culture, and sports. We will develop intelligent industries and expand intelligent living. We will use new technologies, new forms of business, and new models to transform and upgrade the traditional industries. Statistics on emerging industries will be strengthened. We will do more to speed up broadband and bring down internet rates, achieve high-speed broadband access in both urban and rural areas, and make free internet access available in more public places. We will significantly lower the rates of home broadband, and corporate broadband and dedicated internet access services; domestic data roaming charges will be abolished, and rates for mobile internet services will be cut by at least 30 percent. These steps will bring tangible benefits to people and businesses, and boost the development of a Digital China.

加快制造强国建设。推动集成电路、第五代移动通信、飞机发动机、新能源汽车、新材料等产业发展，实施重大短板装备专项工程，发展工业互联网平台，创建 “中国制造 2025”示范区。大幅压减工业生产许可证，强化产品质量监管。全面开展质量提升行动，推进与国际先进水平对标达标，弘扬工匠精神，来一场中国制造的品质革命。<br/>We will speed up work to build China into a leader in manufacturing. We will promote the development of integrated circuits, 5G mobile communications, aircraft engines, new-energy vehicles, and new materials, launch an initiative to shore up weaknesses in major equipment manufacturing, develop industrial Internet of Things platforms, and create Made in China 2025 demonstration zones.<br/>We will significantly scale back industrial production licensing, and strengthen product quality oversight. Taking steps in all sectors to improve quality, we will work toward meeting the highest international standards, encourage the spirit of workmanship, and ignite a revolution in the quality of Chinese-made goods.

**继续破除无效供给。**坚持用市场化法治化手段，严格执行环保、质量、安全等法规标准，化解过剩产能、淘汰落后产能。今年再压减钢铁产能 3000万吨左右，退出煤炭产能 1.5亿吨左右，淘汰关停不达标的 30万千瓦以下煤电机组。加大“僵尸企业”破产清算和重整力度，做好职工安置和债务处置。加快消化粮食库存。减少无效供给要抓出新成效。<br/>**We will continue cutting ineffective supply.**<br/>With a commitment to using approaches consistent with market principles and the rule of law, we will strictly enforce environmental protection, quality, and safety laws, regulations, and standards, and ease overcapacity and close down outdated production facilities. This year, we will further cut steel production capacity by around 30 million metric tons and coal production capacity by approximately 150 million metric tons. Coal-fired power generating units with a capacity of less than 300,000 kilowatts that fail to meet standards will be closed.<br/>We will strengthen work on “zombie enterprise” bankruptcy liquidations and reorganization, and ensure that affected employees are given assistance and debts are dealt with. We will act faster to reduce excess food stockpiles. In cutting ineffective supply, we will knuckle down to produce new results.

**深化“放管服”改革。**全面实施市场准入负面清单制度。在全国推开“证照分离”改革，重点是照后减证，各类证能减尽减、能合则合，进一步压缩企业开办时间。大幅缩短商标注册周期。工程建设项目审批时间再压减一半。全面实施“双随机、一公开”监管，决不允许假冒伪劣滋生蔓延，决不允许执法者吃拿卡要。深入推进“互联网+政务服务”，使更多事项在网上办理，必须到现场办的也要力争做到“只进一扇门”、“最多跑一次”。大力推进综合执法机构机制改革，着力解决多头多层重复执法问题。加快政府信息系统互联互通，打通信息孤岛。清理群众和企业办事的各类证明，没有法律法规依据的一律取消。优化营商环境就是解放生产力、提高竞争力，要破障碍、去烦苛、筑坦途，为市场主体添活力，为人民群众增便利。<br/>**We will deepen the reforms designed to delegate powers, improve regulation, and provide better services.**<br/>A negative list for market access will be instituted nationwide. The reform separating permits and certificates from business licenses will be rolled out nationwide. With the main thrust of this reform being to cut back on the permits and certificates now required once a business license is issued, all that can be cut will be cut, and all that can be merged will be merged. This will further trim a chunk off the time it takes to complete all the procedures required for starting a business. The trademark registration timeline will be significantly shortened, and the time it takes for a construction project to get government approval will again be halved.<br/>We will implement across the board an oversight model using randomly selected inspectors to inspect randomly selected entities and requiring the prompt release of results. There will be zero tolerance for counterfeit and substandard products and corrupt law enforcement.<br/>We will make progress with the Internet Plus Government Services model, enabling more matters to be processed online, and doing our best to see that things requiring presence in person get done in one place and without the need for a second trip. We will work hard to advance the comprehensive institutional reform of law enforcement bodies, focusing on resolving the problem of layers of duplication in law enforcement. We will work faster to develop government information system connectivity and connect up information islands. We will review all types of certificates required of individuals and businesses when accessing government services, and put a stop to anything being required that does not have a basis in law or regulations. Creating a better business environment will unlock productivity and increase competitiveness. We need to remove barriers, cut red tape, and build even pathways, to energize market entities and bring greater convenience to the people.

**进一步减轻企业税负。**改革完善增值税，按照三档并两档方向调整税率水平，重点降低制造业、交通运输等行业税率，提高小规模纳税人年销售额标准。大幅扩展享受减半征收所得税优惠政策的小微企业范围。大幅提高企业新购入仪器设备税前扣除上限。实施企业境外所得综合抵免政策。扩大物流企业仓储用地税收优惠范围。继续实施企业重组土地增值税、契税等到期优惠政策。全年再为企业和个人减税 8000多亿元，促进实体经济转型升级，着力激发市场活力和社会创造力。<br/>**We will further lighten the tax burden on businesses.**<br/>We will reform and improve VAT: We will turn the three tax brackets into two and adjust rates, prioritize lowering rates in manufacturing and transportation, and raise the threshold for annual sales revenue for small-scale taxpayers. Far greater numbers of small low-profit businesses will see their income tax halved, and the ceilings on deductible business purchases of instruments and equipment will be significantly raised. A policy of uniform corporate income tax exemption on the overseas earnings of Chinese businesses will be put into implementation. More logistics companies will enjoy preferential tax treatment on their use of land for storage facilities. Some expiring preferential policies, such as those on VAT and deed transfer tax on land transactions in enterprise reorganizations, will be extended.<br/>These measures will, over the year, reduce taxes on businesses and individuals by more than 800 billion yuan, promote the transformation and upgrading of the real economy, and do much to unleash market vitality and public creativity.

**大幅降低企业非税负担。**进一步清理规范行政事业性收费，调低部分政府性基金征收标准。继续阶段性降低企业“五险一金”缴费比例。降低电网环节收费和输配电价格，一般工商业电价平均降低 10%。深化收费公路制度改革，降低过路过桥费用。加大中介服务收费清理整顿力度。全年要为市场主体减轻非税负担 3000多亿元，不合理的坚决取消，过高的坚决降下来，让企业轻装上阵、聚力发展。<br/>**We will slash non-tax burdens on businesses.**<br/>We will further review and standardize government administrative fees, and lower required payments to some government-managed funds. We will continue the policy of lowering the share paid by businesses for contributions to old-age pension, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, maternity insurance, and housing provident fund schemes for the time being. Power grid charges and electricity transmission and distribution prices will be lowered, and the price of electricity for general industrial and commercial businesses will be cut by an average of 10 percent. We will deepen reform of the system of highway tolls and reduce tolls on highways and bridges. We will thoroughly overhaul charges for intermediary services.By abolishing all unjustified fees and cutting all excessive fees, we expect to lighten the non-tax burden on market entities by over 300 billion yuan this year, which will leave enterprises with a much lighter load and free to focus their resources on their development.

**（二）加快建设创新型国家。**把握世界新一轮科技革命和产业变革大势，深入实施创新驱动发展战略，不断增强经济创新力和竞争力。<br/>**2. Moving faster to make China a country of innovators**<br/>The latest global revolution in science and technology and industrial transformation are trends we must be on board with. We will do more in implementing the innovation-driven development strategy, and keep on making the Chinese economy more innovative and competitive.

**加强国家创新体系建设。**强化基础研究和应用基础研究，启动一批科技创新重大项目，高标准建设国家实验室。鼓励企业牵头实施重大科技项目，支持科研院所、高校与企业融通创新，加快创新成果转化应用。国家科技投入要向民生领域倾斜，加强雾霾治理、癌症等重大疾病防治攻关，使科技更好造福人民。<br/>**We will improve national innovation systems.**<br/>We will strengthen basic research and application-oriented basic research, launch a number of major science and technology innovation programs, and build top-quality national laboratories. We will encourage enterprises to head up major science and technology programs, support collaborative innovation by research institutes, universities, and enterprises, and speed up the commercialization and application of innovations. State investments in science and technology will be weighted toward fields related to improving living standards. We will strengthen efforts to reduce smog and prevent and cure cancers and other serious diseases, thus making science and technology do more to benefit the people.

**落实和完善创新激励政策。**改革科技管理制度，绩效评价要加快从重过程向重结果转变。赋予创新团队和领军人才更大的人财物支配权和技术路线决策权。对承担重大科技攻关任务的科研人员，采取灵活的薪酬制度和奖励措施。探索赋予科研人员科技成果所有权和长期使用权。有悖于激励创新的陈规旧章，要抓紧修改废止；有碍于释放创新活力的繁文缛节，要下决心砍掉。<br/>**We will act on and improve policies that stimulate innovation.**<br/>We will reform the science and technology management system, and speed up the shift in performance assessment from emphasis on processes to emphasis on outcomes. We will empower innovation teams and leaders by seeing that they have more human, financial, and material resources at their disposal and more power to make decisions related to technology roadmaps. For researchers working for major scientific and technological breakthroughs we will adopt flexible remuneration systems and reward schemes. We will explore ways to grant researchers ownership or permanent use rights over their scientific and technological outputs.<br/>All outdated rules and regulations that sap the inspiration for innovation will be modified or abolished without delay, and all red tape that strangles efforts to unlock innovation will be torn clean away.

**促进大众创业、万众创新上水平。**我国拥有世界上规模最大的人力人才资源，这是创新发展的最大“富矿”。要提供全方位创新创业服务，推进“双创”示范基地建设，鼓励大企业、高校和科研院所开放创新资源，发展平台经济、共享经济，形成线上线下结合、产学研用协同、大中小企业融合的创新创业格局，打造“双创”升级版。设立国家融资担保基金，支持优质创新型企业上市融资，将创业投资、天使投资税收优惠政策试点范围扩大到全国。深化人才发展体制改革，推动人力资源自由流动，支持企业提高技术工人待遇，加大高技能人才激励，鼓励海外留学人员回国创新创业，拓宽外国人才来华绿色通道。集众智汇众力，一定能跑出中国创新“加速度”。
**We will see the nationwide business startup and innovation drive is taken to the next level.**<br/>China is home to the biggest pool of human resources and talent in the world. In this we have the greatest gold mine there is for innovation and development. We will provide services that tick every box for inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs, and establish more business startup and innovation demonstration centers. We will encourage large enterprises, universities, and research institutes to enable access to resources necessary for innovation, boost the platform economy and the sharing economy, and create an innovation and entrepreneurship landscape featuring online-offline combination, collaboration between enterprises, universities, research institutes, and end-users, and partnering between businesses of all sizes. With these efforts, we will create an upgraded edition of the national drive to promote business startups and innovation.<br/>We will establish a state financing guaranty fund, support leading innovative enterprises in going public, and extend nationwide the pilot preferential tax policies for venture capital investment and angel investment.<br/>We will deepen the reform of institutions for talent development, promote free flows of human resources, support enterprises in increasing pay packages for technical workers, and strengthen the incentives for highly skilled personnel.<br/>We will encourage overseas Chinese students to return to China after completing their studies to pursue business and other innovative ventures; we will create a fast track to attract more foreign talent to China. We have no doubt that by bringing together myriad intellects and pooling everyone’s energies, China will break into a sprint in innovation.

**（三）深化基础性关键领域改革。**以改革开放 40周年为重要契机，推动改革取得新突破，不断解放和发展社会生产力。<br/>**3. Deepening reforms in fundamental and key areas**We will, drawing on the important momentum generated by the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, endeavor to make new breakthroughs in reform, and continue to unleash and develop productive forces.

We will deepen trial reforms in state capital investment and management companies, and grant them more decision-making power. We will continue moving forward with the improvement and restructuring of SOBs and the joint-stock reform of central government enterprises, and move faster to give shape to corporate governance structures with effective checks and balances and flexible and efficient market-based operating mechanisms. We will work consistently to make SOBs into leaner, better performers, increase the core competitiveness of their main business, and strengthen, expand, and increase returns on state capital.<br/>We will prudently move forward with reforms introducing mixed ownership in SOBs. The system for State Council reporting to the NPC Standing Committee on the management of state-owned assets will be implemented. Our SOBs should, through reform and innovation, become front-runners in pursuing high-quality development.

**支持民营企业发展。**坚持“两个毫不动摇”，坚持权利平等、机会平等、规则平等，全面落实支持非公有制经济发展的政策措施，认真解决民营企业反映的突出问题，坚决破除各种隐性壁垒。构建亲清新型政商关系，健全企业家参与涉企政策制定机制。激发和保护企业家精神，增强企业家信心，让民营企业在市场经济浪潮中尽显身手。<br/>**We will support the development of private enterprises.** There will be no irresolution about consolidating and developing the public sector and no irresolution about encouraging, supporting, and guiding non-public sector development; we will uphold the principle of equal rights, equal opportunities, and fair rules. We will implement fully all policies and measures in support of non-public sector development, earnestly address salient problems that concern private companies, and take firm action to remove hidden barriers.<br/>We will build a new type of cordial and clean relationship between government and business, and improve mechanisms for entrepreneurs to participate in enterprise-related policy formulation. We will encourage and protect entrepreneurship, boost entrepreneur confidence, and enable private enterprises to reach their maximum potential in the market economy.

**完善产权制度和要素市场化配置机制。**产权制度是社会主义市场经济的基石。要以保护产权、维护契约、统一市场、平等交换、公平竞争为基本导向，完善相关法律法规。对各种侵权行为要依法严肃处理，对产权纠纷案件要依法甄别纠正。强化知识产权保护，实行侵权惩罚性赔偿制度。加快技术、土地等要素价格市场化改革，深化资源类产品和公共服务价格改革，打破行政垄断，防止市场垄断。要用有力的产权保护、顺畅的要素流动，让市场活力和社会创造力竞相迸发。<br/>**We will improve property rights systems and mechanisms for market-based allocation of the factors of production. **<br/>The property rights system is the cornerstone of the socialist market economy. We will improve the relevant laws and regulations to see that property rights are protected, contracts are honored, the market is unified, exchanges are equal, and competition is fair. All types of infringements on property rights will be rigorously dealt with in accordance with law, and all property rights dispute cases will be reviewed and settled in accordance with law.<br/>We will strengthen the protection of intellectual property, and enforce a punitive compensation system for intellectual property rights infringements. We will speed up reforms making the pricing of factors of production like technology and land increasingly market-based, deepen reform of the pricing mechanisms for resource products and public services, break government monopolies, and protect against market monopolies.

We will punish theft, robbery, fraud, pornography, gambling, drug-related crime, and other illegal and criminal behavior, and address salient problems such as telecommunications and internet fraud, the abuse of personal information, and pyramid schemes. With these steps we will safeguard national and public security.

各位代表！<br/>Fellow Deputies,

进入新时代，政府工作在新的一年要有新气象新作为。要牢固树立“四个意识”，坚定“四个自信”，坚决维护习近平总书记核心地位，坚决维护党中央权威和集中统一领导，落实全面从严治党要求，加强政府自身建设，深入推进政府职能转变，为人民提供优质高效服务。<br/>Entering a new era, the government’s work in the new year must bring new steps and make new advances. We must become deeply conscious of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment. We must strengthen confidence in the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must resolutely uphold the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping, resolutely uphold the authority of the Party Central Committee and its centralized, unified leadership, and act on the requirement for full and rigorous Party self-governance. We will improve our government, intensify efforts to transform government functions, and deliver to the people high-quality and efficient services.

**全面推进依宪施政、依法行政。**严格遵守宪法法律，加快建设法治政府，把政府活动全面纳入法治轨道。坚持严格规范公正文明执法，有权不可任性，用权必受监督。各级政府要依法接受同级人大及其常委会的监督，自觉接受人民政协的民主监督，主动接受社会和舆论监督，认真听取人大代表、政协委员意见，听取民主党派、工商联、无党派人士和各人民团体意见。政府要信守承诺，决不能“新官不理旧账”。全面推进政务公开。坚持科学、民主、依法决策，凡涉及公众利益的重大事项，都要深入听取各方意见包括批评意见。人民政府的所有工作都要体现人民意愿，干得好不好要看实际效果、最终由人民来评判。<br/>**All governance will be exercised in accordance with the Constitution and the law.**<br/>We will strictly observe the Constitution and the law, and speed up work on building a government based on the rule of law, seeing that all government activities are consistent with the rule of law. We will work to ensure that the law is enforced in a strict, procedure-based, impartial, and civil manner. Power cannot be used as one pleases; the exercise of power must be supervised.<br/>We, at every level of government, must subject ourselves, as required by law, to the oversight of the people’s congresses at that level and their standing committees; we must readily accept the democratic oversight of CPPCC committees, and we must actively accept public oversight and oversight through public opinion. We should earnestly solicit opinions from deputies to people’s congresses and CPPCC committee members, and listen to the views of other political parties, federations of industry and commerce, public figures without party affiliation, and people’s organizations.<br/>We in government must honor our commitments; new officials must not be allowed to disavow obligations undertaken by their predecessors. We will make government affairs more transparent across the board. Decisions will be made in a sound and democratic way on the basis of law, and before making decisions on any major issue related to public interests, we will solicit input, including criticism, from all parties.<br/>Ours is a government of the people, and everything we do should reflect their will. Whether we’ve done a good job only the outcomes can tell and ultimately it is for the people to judge.

**全面加强党风廉政建设。**推进“两学一做”学习教育常态化制度化，认真开展“不忘初心、牢记使命”主题教育。坚决贯彻落实党中央八项规定及实施细则精神，驰而不息整治 “四风”，特别是力戒形式主义、官僚主义。加强审计监督。巩固发展反腐败斗争压倒性态势，把权力关进制度的笼子，坚决惩治各类腐败行为。政府工作人员要廉洁修身，勤勉尽责，干干净净为人民做事，决不辜负人民公仆的称号。<br/>**All initiatives to improve Party conduct and ensure clean government will be strengthened.**<br/>All Party members should gain a good command of the Party Constitution, Party regulations, and General Secretary Xi Jinping’s major policy addresses, and meet Party standards; we will work to see this become a regular and institutionalized practice. And we will keep reminding ourselves of our commitment to our original aspiration and have our mission always in mind.<br/>We must resolutely put into action the central Party leadership’s eight-point decision on improving conduct and staying engaged with the people and its detailed rules for implementation. We should work ceaselessly to address the practice of formalities for formalities’ sake, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance, with particular focus on seeing the first two stamped out.<br/>We will strengthen auditing-based oversight. We will consolidate and build on the overwhelming momentum of the anti-corruption campaign, locking power in an institutional cage, and cracking down on all manifestations of corruption.<br/>All government employees must cultivate personal integrity and have a strong work ethic and sense of responsibility; we must keep our hands clean and work hard for the people, and never fail to live up to the name of the people’s public servants.

**全面提高政府效能。**优化政府机构设置和职能配置，深化机构改革，形成职责明确、依法行政的政府治理体系，增强政府公信力和执行力。中国改革发展的一切成就，都是干出来的。对各级政府及其工作人员来说，为人民干事是天职、不干是失职。要完善激励约束、容错纠错机制，旗帜鲜明给积极干事者撑腰鼓劲，对庸政懒政者严肃问责。决不能表态多调门高、行动少落实差，决不允许占着位子不干事。广大干部要提高政治素质和工作本领，求真务实，干字当头，干出实打实的新业绩，干出群众的好口碑，干出千帆竞发、百舸争流的生动局面。<br/>**All aspects of government performance will be improved.**<br/>We will improve government institution setups and functions, deepen institutional reform, form a system of governance by government with clearly defined duties and obligations and administration in line with law, and strengthen government credibility and executive capacity.<br/>Every last achievement in China’s reform and development has been made by doing. To us – all levels of government and all government employees – getting things done for the people is our unquestionable duty; not doing is a dereliction of that duty.<br/>We will improve incentive and restraint mechanisms and mechanisms to allow for and address errors, give unequivocal backing to the driven and the doers, and hold strictly to account the incompetent and the idle. Talking big and setting ambitious goals but taking little action to achieve them will not be tolerated; nor will sitting around in a government post and getting nothing done.<br/>We in government need to improve our political integrity and professional competence, be realistic and pragmatic, and make doing our top priority. Only by doing can we make solid new achievements, earn public endorsement, and contribute to a dynamic atmosphere in which everyone is motivated and driven to get things done.

We will stick to the Chinese path in strengthening our armed forces, advance all aspects of military training and war preparedness, and firmly and resolvedly safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests.<br/>The fundamental principle and system of absolute leadership by the Party over the armed forces must be observed, and the system of the Chairman of the Central Military Commission assuming full responsibility for military affairs will be fully enforced.<br/>We will continue to reform national defense and the armed forces, and build strong and solid modernized border, coastal, and air defense. We will improve our national defense mobilization system and strengthen public awareness about national defense. We will further implement the strategy for military-civilian integration and deepen reform of defense-related science, technology, and industry.<br/>We, at every level of government, must take more effective measures to support the development and reform of our national defense and armed forces, so that the unity between government and the military and between the people and the military is always strong as stone, and deeply rooted as an evergreen.
