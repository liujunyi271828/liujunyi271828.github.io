> 能愿动词介绍.

英文原文请见[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). 这里放上核心的信息. 我们平时是用英文版的居多.

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify the requirements in the specification. These words are often capitalized. This document defines these words as they should be interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement level of the document in which they are used.

## 英文版术语
   
### 1. 必须 - MUST 

This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification. 这相当于广大员工常听到的“**肯定行**”“**没问题**”“**放一万个心**”; 也可以用绝对四连“**必须要**xxxx, **乃至于**xxxx, **甚至是**xxxx, **一定要**xxxxx.”来描述.

### 2. MUST NOT - 一定不能 

This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.

### 3. SHOULD - 应当  

This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course. 

### 4. SHOULD NOT - 不应  

This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. 
   
### 5. MAY - 可, OPTIONAL - 可选的

This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.) 举例: 大家的努力领导都看在眼里, 年底**会**有说法.


## xxx领域/行业(如建筑、交通等)中的中文规范的用词

1）表示很严格, 非要这样做不可的: 

正面词采用“必须”, 反面词采用“严禁”; 
  

2）表示严格, 在正常情况下均应这样做的:

3）表示允许稍有选择, 在条件许可时首先应这样做的: 


正面词采用“宜”, 反面词采用“不宜”; 


4）表示有选择, 在一定条件下可以这样做的, 采用“可”.
