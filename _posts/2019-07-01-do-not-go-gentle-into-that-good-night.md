Do not go gentle into that good night,<br/>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br/>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br/>
Because their words had forked no lightning they<br/>
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br/>
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br/>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br/>
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br/>
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br/>
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br/>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br/>
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br/>
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br/>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
