> 第一次见，查一下。

本来我想写写 `<h>`, 结果发现这篇文章正文里只有 `<h2>`, 那就 `<h2>` 吧😂我把文章中 `<h2>` 里的 `'` 和 `"` 都转义了，省着横生枝节。主要是也不费什么事儿，拿 [HTML Punctuation Symbols，Punctuation Entities and ASCII Character Code Reference](https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/punctuation/) 一查就完事儿了。

看文档的时候看到这么一个 *pros and cons*, 不认识，以前没见过这个词。查一下。

## [What Is The Origin Of The Term &quot;Pros And Cons&quot;?](https://www.lexico.com/en/explore/pros-and-cons-origin)

> The phrase ‘pros and cons’ is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase *pro et contra*，‘for and against’，and has been in use in the abbreviated form since the 16th century，according to the *Oxford English Dictionary*.
> 
> ‘Pros and cons’ is a well-established standard usage; Oxford’s larger dictionaries do not mark it as ‘informal’ or in any way restricted in use。The much longer alternative is the phrase ‘arguments for and against’.
