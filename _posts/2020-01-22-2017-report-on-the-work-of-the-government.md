I also wish to have comments on my report from the members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

一、2016年工作回顾<br/>Review of our work in 2016

过去一年，我国发展面临国内外诸多矛盾叠加、风险隐患交汇的严峻挑战。在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，全国各族人民迎难而上，砥砺前行，推动经济社会持续健康发展。党的十八届六中全会正式明确习近平总书记的核心地位，体现了党和人民的根本利益，对保证党和国家兴旺发达、长治久安，具有十分重大而深远的意义。各地区、各部门不断增强政治意识、大局意识、核心意识、看齐意识，推动全面建成小康社会取得新的重要进展，全面深化改革迈出重大步伐，全面依法治国深入实施，全面从严治党纵深推进，全年经济社会发展主要目标任务圆满完成，“十三五”实现了良好开局。<br/>In the past year, China's development has faced grave challenges posed by a great many problems and interwoven risks and dangers both at home and abroad.However, under the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, we the Chinese people have risen to the challenge and worked hard to press ahead, driving forward sustained, healthy economic and social development.At the Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th Party Central Committee,the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping was formally affirmed, which reflects the fundamental interests of the Party and the Chinese people, and is of crucial and far-reaching significance for ensuring the flourishing and long-term stability of the Party and the country. All regions and all government departments have steadily strengthened their consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, uphold the leadership core, and keep in alignment.Pushing ahead with all-around efforts, we have achieved major progress in finishing building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, made important strides in deepening reform, continued to exercise law-based governance, and made further progress in practicing strict Party self-governance; and we have accomplished the year's main tasks and targets for economic and social development, and got the 13th Five-Year Plan off to a great start.

Emerging industries were thriving, and the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries accelerated. People were busy launching businesses or making innovations, with a 24.5-percent year-on-year increase in the number of new businesses registered-an average of 15,000 new businesses daily.With self-employed traders and other market entities included we had an average of 45,000 new market entities launched per day.

People in both urban and rural areas saw arise in living standards.

我国成功主办二十国集团领导人杭州峰会，推动取得一系列开创性、引领性、机制性重要成果，在全球经济治理中留下深刻的中国印记。<br/>China successfully hosted the G20 2016 Hangzhou Summit, and helped to deliver a number of important pioneering, leading, and institutional outcomes, thus doing its part for global economic governance.

回顾过去一年，走过的路很不寻常。我们面对的是世界经济和贸易增速7年来最低、国际金融市场波动加剧、地区和全球性挑战突发多发的外部环境，面对的是国内结构性问题突出、风险隐患显现、经济下行压力加大的多重困难，面对的是改革进入攻坚期、利益关系深刻调整、影响社会稳定因素增多的复杂局面。在这种情况下，经济能够稳住很不容易，出现诸多向好变化更为难得。这再次表明，中国人民有勇气、有智慧、有能力战胜任何艰难险阻，中国经济有潜力、有韧性、有优势，中国的发展前景一定会更好。<br/>2016 was an unusual year in our country's development. China was confronted with an external environment in which the world saw the lowest economic and trade growth in seven years, growing volatility in global financial markets, and sudden and frequent regional and global challenges.Domestically, China faced multiple difficulties: major structural problems, prominent risks and dangers, and mounting downward pressure on the economy. China found itself in a complex environment as reform entered a critical stage, profound changes took place affecting interests, and factors impacting social stability grew.Given all these factors, it was not easy for us to maintain stable economic performance. And yet we succeeded, and even managed to make progress on many fronts. Once again, this shows that we the Chinese people have the courage, ingenuity, and ability to overcome any difficulty or hardship. It also shows that the Chinese economy possesses potential, resilience, and strengths, so we can be sure there is even better development ahead for China.

一年来，我们主要做了以下工作。<br/>I will now move on to discuss our main work last year:

一是继续创新和加强宏观调控，经济运行保持在合理区间。去年宏观调控面临多难抉择，我们坚持不搞“大水漫灌”式强刺激，而是依靠改革创新来稳增长、调结构、防风险，在区间调控基础上，加强定向调控、相机调控。积极的财政政策力度加大，增加的财政赤字主要用于减税降费。全面推开营改增试点，全年降低企业税负5700多亿元，所有行业实现税负只减不增。制定实施中央与地方增值税收入划分过渡方案，确保地方既有财力不变。扩大地方政府存量债务置换规模，降低利息负担约4000亿元。稳健的货币政策灵活适度，广义货币M2增长11.3%，低于13%左右的预期目标。综合运用多种货币政策工具，支持实体经济发展。实施促进消费升级措施。出台鼓励民间投资等政策，投资出现企稳态势。分类调控房地产市场。加强金融风险防控，人民币汇率形成机制进一步完善，保持了在合理均衡水平上的基本稳定，维护了国家经济金融安全。<br/>First, we continued to develop new and more effective ways of carrying out regulation at the macro level, thus keeping the economy performing within an appropriate range.<br/>Last year, we faced difficult choices in conducting macro-level regulation, but we stood firm in not adopting strong stimulus policies that would have had an economy-wide impact, and strived instead to maintain steady growth, adjust the structure, and guard against risks through reform and innovation. We strengthened targeted and well-timed regulation on the basis of range-based regulation.<br/>More proactive fiscal policy was pursued, and the increase in the fiscal deficit was used mainly to cover tax and fee cuts. The trial replacement of business tax with value added tax (VAT) was extended to cover all sectors, slashing the tax burden of businesses for the year by over 570 billion yuan and reducing tax burdens in every sector. A transitional plan for sharing VAT revenue between the central and local governments was formulated and implemented to ensure financial resources of local governments remained unchanged. More local government bonds were issued to replace outstanding debts, reducing interest payments by roughly 400 billion yuan.<br/>A prudent monetary policy was pursued in a flexible and appropriate manner.The M2 money supply increased by 11.3 percent, below our projected target of around 13 percent. We used a range of monetary policy tools to support the development of the real economy.<br/>Measures were taken to upgrade consumption. We unveiled policies to encourage private investment, and saw investment begin to stabilize. We exercised category-based regulation over the real estate market. We strengthened efforts to manage financial risks. The RMB exchange rate regime continued to improve, and the exchange rate remained generally stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. With these measures, we have safeguarded China's economic and financial security.

二是着力抓好“三去一降一补”，供给结构有所改善。以钢铁、煤炭行业为重点去产能，全年退出钢铁产能超过6500万吨、煤炭产能超过2.9亿吨，超额完成年度目标任务，分流职工得到较好安置。支持农民工在城镇购房，提高棚改货币化安置比例，房地产去库存取得积极成效。推动企业兼并重组，发展直接融资，实施市场化法治化债转股，工业企业资产负债率有所下降。着眼促进企业降成本，出台减税降费、降低“五险一金”缴费比例、下调用电价格等举措。加大补短板力度，办了一批当前急需又利长远的大事。<br/>Second, we focused on five priority tasks -- cutting overcapacity, reducing excess inventory, deleveraging, lowering costs, and strengthening areas of weakness -- thereby improving the composition of supply.<br/>Particular priority was given to cutting overcapacity in the steel and coal sectors. Over the year, steel production capacity was cut by more than 65 million metric tons and coal by over 290 million metric tons, going beyond annual targets. Effective assistance was provided to laid-off employees.<br/>We supported migrant workers in buying urban homes; and we increased the proportion of people affected by rebuilding in rundown urban areas receiving monetary compensation, making good progress in reducing real estate inventory.<br/>Business acquisitions and reorganizations were encouraged, direct financing was promoted, and market- and law-based debt-to-equity swaps were carried out, lowering the debt-to-asset ratio of industrial enterprises.<br/>To help enterprises lower operating costs, we introduced measures to cut taxes and fees, lower the share paid by enterprises for social security contributions(Notes: This includes old-age insurance, health insurance, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, maternity insurance, and housing provident fund schemes). We boosted efforts to strengthen areas of weakness and undertook major initiatives that both help to meet urgent needs today and promise long-term benefits.

三是大力深化改革开放，发展活力进一步增强。全面深化改革，推出一批标志性、支柱性改革举措。围绕处理好政府和市场关系这一经济体制改革的核心问题，持续推进简政放权、放管结合、优化服务改革。在提前完成本届政府减少行政审批事项三分之一目标的基础上，去年又取消165项国务院部门及其指定地方实施的审批事项，清理规范192项审批中介服务事项、220项职业资格许可认定事项。深化商事制度改革。全面推行“双随机、一公开”，增强事中事后监管的有效性，推进“互联网+政务服务”。推动国有企业调整重组和混合所有制改革。建立公平竞争审查制度。深化资源税改革。完善农村土地“三权分置”办法，建立贫困退出机制。推进科技管理体制改革，扩大高校和科研院所自主权，出台以增加知识价值为导向的分配政策。放开养老服务市场。扩大公立医院综合改革试点，深化药品医疗器械审评审批制度改革。制定自然资源统一确权登记办法，开展省以下环保机构监测监察执法垂直管理、耕地轮作休耕改革等试点，全面推行河长制，健全生态保护补偿机制。改革为经济社会发展增添了新动力。<br/>Third, we worked hard to deepen reform and opening up, further strengthening the vitality of development.Reform was deepened across the board, and a good number of landmark and pillar reform initiatives were undertaken.<br/>To balance the government-market relationship -- the pivotal issue in economic structural reform -- we continued reforms to streamline administration, delegate powers, and improve regulation and services. My administration's goal of cutting the number of items requiring government review by a third had been achieved ahead of schedule. On that basis, last year we cancelled the requirement on a further 165 items for review by State Council departments and authorized local governments. We also overhauled and standardized 192 items of intermediary services for government review as well as 220 items of approvals and accreditations for professional qualifications. We deepened institutional reforms in the business sector. We introduced an oversight model of random inspection and public release across the board(Note: The model comprises inspections of randomly selected entities by randomly selected inspectors and the public release of inspection results., and cut the price of electricity), made operational and post-operational oversight more effective, and promoted the Internet Plus government services model.<br/>We pushed ahead with reforms to restructure and reorganize state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and introduce into them mixed ownership structures. We established a review system to ensure fair competition. We deepened resource tax reforms.<br/>We improved measures for separating rural land ownership rights, contract rights, and management rights, and established a mechanism for determining whether people have been lifted out of poverty. We made progress in reforming the science and technology management system, gave greater autonomy to colleges and research institutes, and adopted profit distribution policies oriented toward increasing the value of knowledge. We opened up the elderly services market. We expanded the trials of comprehensive reforms in public hospitals and deepened reform of the evaluation and approval systems for medicine and medical equipment.<br/>We formulated unified measures to determine and register natural resource rights. We piloted reforms for conducting direct oversight by provincial-level environmental protection agencies over the environmental monitoring and inspection work of environmental protection agencies below the provincial level, as well as crop rotation and fallow land reforms. The river chief system was introduced for all lakes and rivers across the country, and the mechanisms for compensating for ecological conservation efforts were improved. Reform has given new impetus to economic and social development.

积极扩大对外开放。推进“一带一路”建设，与沿线国家加强战略对接、务实合作。人民币正式纳入国际货币基金组织特别提款权货币篮子。“深港通”开启。完善促进外贸发展措施，新设12个跨境电子商务综合试验区，进出口逐步回稳。推广上海等自贸试验区改革创新成果，新设7个自贸试验区。除少数实行准入特别管理措施领域外，外资企业设立及变更一律由审批改为备案管理。实际使用外资1300多亿美元，继续位居发展中国家首位。<br/>We opened China wider to the rest of the world. As we pushed ahead with the Belt and Road Initiative, we worked to increase complementarity between the development strategies of, and practical cooperation between, China and other countries along the routes.
The RMB was formally included in the IMF's Special Drawing Rights basket. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched. We improved measures for promoting trade, and built 12 new integrated experimental zones for cross-border e-commerce, bringing about a steady recovery in the volume of import and export.<br/>The new practices of pilot free trade zones in Shanghai and elsewhere were used to establish another seven pilot zones. The requirement for review and approval for setting up and making significant adjustments to foreign enterprises was replaced by a simple filing process, with the exception of a few areas where special market access requirements apply. In 2016, China utilized more than US$130 billion of overseas investment, continuing to rank first among developing countries.

四是强化创新引领，新动能快速成长。深入推进“互联网+”行动和国家大数据战略，全面实施《中国制造2025》，落实和完善“双创”政策措施。部署启动面向2030年的科技创新重大项目，支持北京、上海建设具有全球影响力的科技创新中心，新设6个国家自主创新示范区。全社会研发经费支出与国内生产总值之比达到2.08%。国内有效发明专利拥有量突破100万件，技术交易额超过1万亿元。科技进步贡献率上升到56.2%，创新对发展的支撑作用明显增强。<br/>Fourth, we strengthened innovation's leading role, spurring the rapid development of new growth drivers.We took further steps to implement the Internet Plus action plan and the national big data strategy, fully implemented the Made in China 2025 initiative, and implemented and improved policies and measures to encourage people to launch businesses and innovate. We developed and launched a plan for completing major science and technology programs by 2030, supported Beijing and Shanghai in building themselves into global R&D centers, and established another six national innovation demonstration zones.<br/>China's R&D spending reached 2.08 percent of GDP. The number of in-force Chinese patents issued in China passed the million mark, and the value of technology transactions exceeded one trillion yuan. The contribution of scientific and technological progress to economic growth rose to 56.2 percent, and innovation's role in powering development grew markedly.

五是促进区域城乡协调发展，新的增长极增长带加快形成。深入实施“一带一路”建设、京津冀协同发展、长江经济带发展三大战略，启动建设一批重点项目。编制西部大开发“十三五”规划，实施新一轮东北振兴战略，推动中部地区崛起，支持东部地区率先发展。加快推进新型城镇化，深化户籍制度改革，全面推行居住证制度，又有1600万人进城落户。发展的协同叠加效应不断显现。<br/>Fifth, we promoted more balanced development between regions and between rural and urban areas, and saw faster emergence of new growth poles and growth belts.We stepped up work to implement the three strategic initiatives (the Belt and Road, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration, and the Yangtze Economic Belt), and began construction on a number of key projects. We formulated the plan for the 13th Five-Year Plan period for large-scale development in the western region, launched a new round of initiatives as part of the Northeast revitalization strategy, drove progress in the rise of the central region, and supported the eastern region in leading the rest of the country in pursuing development. We sped up efforts to promote new types of urbanization, deepened reform of the household registration system, introduced the residence card system nationwide, and granted urban residency to another 16 million people from rural areas. The synergy building through coordinated development became more and more evident.

六是加强生态文明建设，绿色发展取得新进展。制定实施生态文明建设目标评价考核办法，建设国家生态文明试验区。强化大气污染治理，二氧化硫、氮氧化物排放量分别下降5.6%和4%，74个重点城市细颗粒物（PM2.5）年均浓度下降9.1%。优化能源结构，清洁能源消费比重提高1.7个百分点，煤炭消费比重下降2个百分点。推进水污染防治，出台土壤污染防治行动计划。开展中央环境保护督察，严肃查处一批环境违法案件，推动了环保工作深入开展。<br/>Sixth, we strengthened ecological conservation and made fresh progress in pursuing green development.We formulated and introduced measures for assessing progress made in ecological improvement, and established national pilot zones for ecological conservation. We took stronger measures against air pollution and, as a result, saw a 5.6-percent decline in sulfur dioxide emissions, a 4-percent cut in nitrogen oxide emissions, and a 9.1-percent drop in the annual average density of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in 74 key cities. We continued to improve the energy mix, increasing the share of clean energy consumption by 1.7 percentage points and cutting the share of coal consumption by 2 percentage points.<br/>We continued efforts to prevent and control water pollution, and adopted an action plan for preventing and controlling soil pollution. Central government inspections on environmental protection accountability were launched and violations of environmental protection laws were investigated and prosecuted, giving impetus to deeper efforts to protect the environment.

七是注重保障和改善民生，人民群众获得感增强。在财政收支压力加大情况下，民生投入继续增加。出台新的就业创业政策，扎实做好重点人群、重点地区就业工作。全面推进脱贫攻坚，全国财政专项扶贫资金投入超过1000亿元。提高低保、优抚、退休人员基本养老金等标准，为1700多万困难和重度残疾人发放生活或护理补贴。财政性教育经费支出占国内生产总值比例继续超过4%。重点高校招收贫困地区农村学生人数增长21.3%。免除农村贫困家庭学生普通高中学杂费。全年资助各类学校家庭困难学生8400多万人次。整合城乡居民基本医保制度，提高财政补助标准。增加基本公共卫生服务经费。实现大病保险全覆盖，符合规定的省内异地就医住院费用可直接结算。加强基层公共文化服务。实施全民健身计划，体育健儿在里约奥运会、残奥会上再创佳绩。去年部分地区特别是长江流域发生严重洪涝等灾害，通过及时有力开展抢险救灾，紧急转移安置900多万人次，最大限度降低了灾害损失，恢复重建有序进行。<br/>Seventh, we gave particular attention to ensuring and improving living standards, helping Chinese people gain a stronger sense of benefit.<br/>Despite growing pressure from fiscal imbalance, we continued to increase inputs in areas related to living standards. We launched new policies on employment and business startups, and carried out solid work on increasing employment for key target groups and priority regions. We made all-around progress in key battles to eradicate poverty and earmarked over 100 billion yuan from government budgets for poverty relief. We increased subsistence allowances, benefits for entitled groups, basic pension payments, and other subsidies; and over 17 million people benefited through the provision of cost-of-living allowances for people with disabilities in financial difficulty and nursing care subsidies for people with severe disabilities.<br/>Fiscal spending on education continued to be over 4 percent of GDP. The number of students from poor rural areas enrolled in key universities grew by 21.3 percent. We waived tuition and miscellaneous fees for students from poor rural families at regular senior high schools. Over the course of the year, more than 84 million grants were given to students from poor families studying in all types of schools.<br/>The basic health insurance systems for rural and nonworking urban residents were merged and government subsidies for the system were increased. More funding was provided for basic public health services. Full coverage of the serious disease insurance scheme was achieved, and healthcare costs meeting relevant provisions can now be settled on the spot when incurred anywhere within the provincial-level administrative area where insurance is registered.<br/>We increased public cultural services at the community level. The Fitness for All initiative was launched, and Chinese athletes gave an excellent performance at the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.<br/>Last year, parts of the country, especially the Yangtze basin, were hit by severe flooding and other disasters. We acted quickly to provide effective rescue and relief, swiftly relocated over 9 million people, minimized damage and loss, and made systematic progress with recovery and reconstruction efforts.

八是推进政府建设和治理创新，社会保持和谐稳定。国务院提请全国人大常委会审议法律议案13件，制定修订行政法规8件。完善公共决策吸纳民意机制，认真办理人大代表建议和政协委员提案。推进政务公开，省级政府部门权力和责任清单全面公布。加大督查问责力度，组织开展第三次国务院大督查，对去产能、民间投资等政策落实情况进行专项督查和第三方评估，严肃查处一些地区违规新建钢铁项目、生产销售“地条钢”等行为。加强安全生产工作，事故总量和重特大事故数量继续下降。强化社会治安综合治理，依法打击违法犯罪，有力维护了国家安全和公共安全。<br/>Eighth, we continued to enhance government performance and improve governance, thus ensuring social harmony and stability.<br/>The State Council submitted 13 legislative proposals to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) for approval and adopted or revised 8 sets of administrative regulations. We improved mechanisms for drawing on public opinions in decision making on public issues and worked with keen attention to handle the proposals and suggestions of NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members. We made progress in strengthening government transparency by releasing lists of the powers and responsibilities of all provincial-level government departments.<br/>We intensified accountability inspections. The third State Council accountability inspection was carried out; special inspections and third-party evaluations were conducted on the implementation of policies related to cutting overcapacity and encouraging private investment; and new steel projects launched in breach of regulations and the production and sale of substandard steel products were strictly investigated and dealt with.<br/>We strengthened workplace safety efforts and saw a continued decline in the total number of accidents and in the number of accidents of a serious nature.<br/>We took comprehensive measures to maintain law and order and, in accordance with law, cracked down on crime and other violations, effectively safeguarding national and public security.

扎实开展“两学一做”学习教育，认真落实党中央八项规定精神，坚决纠正“四风”，严格执行国务院“约法三章”。依法惩处一批腐败分子，反腐败斗争形成压倒性态势。<br/>We carried out in earnest activities to enable Party members to gain a good understanding of the Party Constitution, Party regulations, and General Secretary Xi Jinping's major policy addresses and to meet Party standards. We worked scrupulously to ensure compliance with the Party Central Committee's eight-point decision on improving Party and government conduct, took firm action to address formalism, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance, and rigorously enforced the State Council's three-point decision on curbing government spending. We punished a number of corrupt officials in accordance with law, and the fight against corruption has built up irresistible momentum.

I express our sincere appreciation to our fellow countrymen and women in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and in Taiwan, and to Chinese nationals overseas. I also wish to express our heartfelt thanks to the governments of other countries, international organizations, and friends from all over the world who have shown understanding and support for China in its endeavor to modernize.

我们也清醒看到，经济社会发展中还存在不少困难和问题。经济增长内生动力仍需增强，部分行业产能过剩严重，一些企业生产经营困难较多，地区经济走势分化，财政收支矛盾较大，经济金融风险隐患不容忽视。环境污染形势依然严峻，特别是一些地区严重雾霾频发，治理措施需要进一步加强。在住房、教育、医疗、养老、食品药品安全、收入分配等方面，人民群众还有不少不满意的地方。煤矿、建筑、交通等领域发生了一些重大安全事故，令人痛心。政府工作存在不足，有些改革举措和政策落实不到位，涉企收费多、群众办事难等问题仍较突出，行政执法中存在不规范不公正不文明现象，少数干部懒政怠政、推诿扯皮，一些领域腐败问题时有发生。我们一定要直面挑战，敢于担当，全力以赴做好政府工作，不辱历史使命，不负人民重托。<br/>Yet we must not lose sight of the many problems and challenges China faces in pursuing economic and social development. The internal forces driving economic growth need to be strengthened. Overcapacity poses a serious challenge in some industries. Some enterprises face difficulties in their production and operations. Economic prospects for different regions are divergent. Fiscal imbalance is becoming great. And potential economic and financial risks cannot be overlooked.<br/>Environmental pollution remains grave, and in particular, some areas are frequently hit by heavy smog. We need to further strengthen our steps to combat pollution. There are also many problems causing public concern in housing, education, healthcare, elderly care, food and drug safety, and income distribution. It is distressing that there were some major accidents in the coal mining, construction, and transportation sectors.<br/>There is still room for improvement in government performance. Some reform policies and measures have not been fully implemented. Excess fees and charges being levied on businesses and difficulties facing individuals who want to access government services remain standout problems. We still see problems of laws and regulations being enforced in a non-standard, unfair, or uncivil way. A small number of government employees are lazy and neglectful of their duties or shirk responsibility. Corruption often occurs in some sectors.<br/>We must confront these challenges head-on, be ready to bear the weight of responsibility, and do our all to deliver. We must fulfill our historic mission and live up to the great trust placed in us by the Chinese people.

二、2017年工作总体部署<br/>What the government will do in 2017

今年将召开中国共产党第十九次全国代表大会，是党和国家事业发展中具有重大意义的一年。做好政府工作，要在以习近平同志为核心的党中央领导下，高举中国特色社会主义伟大旗帜，全面贯彻党的十八大和十八届三中、四中、五中、六中全会精神，以邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观为指导，深入贯彻习近平总书记系列重要讲话精神和治国理政新理念新思想新战略，统筹推进“五位一体”总体布局和协调推进“四个全面”战略布局，坚持稳中求进工作总基调，牢固树立和贯彻落实新发展理念，适应把握引领经济发展新常态，坚持以提高发展质量和效益为中心，坚持宏观政策要稳、产业政策要准、微观政策要活、改革政策要实、社会政策要托底的政策思路，坚持以推进供给侧结构性改革为主线，适度扩大总需求，加强预期引导，深化创新驱动，全面做好稳增长、促改革、调结构、惠民生、防风险各项工作，保持经济平稳健康发展和社会和谐稳定，以优异成绩迎接党的十九大胜利召开。<br/>This year, the Communist Party of China will hold its 19th National Congress, so it will be a year of great significance for advancing the cause of the Party and our country. To deliver in our work this year, the government will do the following:<br/>-- Follow the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core<br/>-- Hold high the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics<br/>-- Implement fully the guidelines from the 18th National Party Congress and those of the third through sixth plenary sessions of the 18th Party Central Committee<br/>-- Take as our guide Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development<br/>-- Put into practice the principles from General Secretary Xi Jinping's major addresses and his new vision, thinking, and strategies for China's governance<br/>-- Promote balanced economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological progress and coordinated implementation of the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy (Note: This refers to making comprehensive moves to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, deepen reform, advance the law-based governance of China, and strengthen Party self-governance)<br/>-- Remain committed to the underlying principle of making progress while keeping performance stable<br/>-- Gain a strong understanding of and put into practice the new development philosophy<br/>-- Adapt to, approach in the right way, and steer the new normal in economic development<br/>-- Give central importance to improving the quality and returns of development<br/>-- Ensure that macro-level policy is consistent, industrial policy is targeted, micro-level policy injects dynamism into the market, reform policy delivers outcomes, and social policy sees basic living needs are met<br/>-- Focus on supply-side structural reform<br/>-- Expand aggregate demand as appropriate<br/>-- Do better in guiding expectations<br/>-- Strengthen the role of innovation in driving development<br/>-- Maintain stable growth, promote reform, make structural adjustments, improve living standards, and guard against risks<br/>-- Maintain stable and sound economic development as well as social harmony and stability<br/>These efforts should enable us to pave the way for the 19th National Party Congress with outstanding achievements.

综合分析国内外形势，我们要做好应对更加复杂严峻局面的充分准备。世界经济增长低迷态势仍在延续，“逆全球化”思潮和保护主义倾向抬头，主要经济体政策走向及外溢效应变数较大，不稳定不确定因素明显增加。我国发展处在爬坡过坎的关键阶段，经济运行存在不少突出矛盾和问题。困难不容低估，信心不可动摇。我国物质基础雄厚、人力资源充裕、市场规模庞大、产业配套齐全、科技进步加快、基础设施比较完善，经济发展具有良好支撑条件，宏观调控还有不少创新手段和政策储备。我们坚信，有党的坚强领导，坚持党的基本路线，坚定不移走中国特色社会主义道路，依靠人民群众的无穷创造力，万众一心、奋力拼搏，我国发展一定能够创造新的辉煌。<br/>The developments both in and outside of China require that we are ready to face more complicated and graver situations. World economic growth remains sluggish, and both the deglobalization trend and protectionism are growing. There are many uncertainties about the direction of the major economies' policies and their spillover effects, and the factors that could cause instability and uncertainty are visibly increasing. China is at a crucial and challenging stage in its own development endeavors, and there are many salient challenges and problems in the economy.<br/>The difficulties we face are not to be underestimated, but we must remain confident that they will be overcome. China has a solid material foundation, abundant human resources, a huge market, and a complete system of industries. It is making faster scientific and technological progress, and has a complete range of infrastructure. We have good conditions for sustaining economic development, and many innovative tools and policy options for conducting macroeconomic regulation. We should follow the leadership of the Party, uphold the Party's fundamental political guidelines, and keep to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics;we should rely on the inexhaustible creativity of the people, unite as one, and forge ahead. It is our firm belief that by doing this, we will make great new achievements in China's development.

今年发展的主要预期目标是：国内生产总值增长6.5%左右，在实际工作中争取更好结果；居民消费价格涨幅3%左右；城镇新增就业1100万人以上，城镇登记失业率4.5%以内；进出口回稳向好，国际收支基本平衡；居民收入和经济增长基本同步；单位国内生产总值能耗下降3.4%以上，主要污染物排放量继续下降。<br/>Based on the above considerations, we have set the following key projected targets for development this year:<br/>-- GDP growth of around 6.5 percent, or higher if possible in practice<br/>-- CPI increase kept at around 3 percent<br/>-- Over 11 million new urban jobs, and a registered urban unemployment rate within 4.5 percent<br/>-- A steady rise in import and export volumes, and a basic balance in international payments<br/>-- Increases in personal income basically in step with economic growth<br/>-- A reduction of at least 3.4 percent in energy consumption per unit of GDP, and continued reductions in the release of major pollutants

今年的经济增长预期目标，符合经济规律和客观实际，有利于引导和稳定预期、调整结构，也同全面建成小康社会要求相衔接。稳增长的重要目的是为了保就业、惠民生。今年就业压力加大，要坚持就业优先战略，实施更加积极的就业政策。城镇新增就业预期目标比去年多100万人，突出了更加重视就业的导向。从经济基本面和就业吸纳能力看，这一目标通过努力是能够实现的。<br/>The projected target for this year's growth is realistic and in keeping with economic principles; it will help steer and steady expectations and make structural adjustments; and it will help achieve the goal of finishing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects.
An important reason for stressing the need to maintain stable growth is to ensure employment and improve people's lives. As employment pressure grows this year, we will continue to give top priority to creating jobs and implement a more proactive employment policy. This year's target for urban job creation is one million more than last year, underlining the greater importance we are attaching to employment. Considering our sound economic fundamentals and the capacity they bring for job creation, with hard work, this target is attainable.

今年要继续实施积极的财政政策和稳健的货币政策，在区间调控基础上加强定向调控、相机调控，提高预见性、精准性和有效性，注重消费、投资、区域、产业、环保等政策的协调配合，确保经济运行在合理区间。<br/>This year, we will continue to pursue a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy. On the basis of conducting range-based regulation, we will focus more on targeted and well-timed regulation and increase the foresight, precision, and effectiveness of our regulation. We will strengthen coordination of consumption, investment, regional, industrial, and environmental protection policies, and ensure the economy performs within an appropriate range.

财政政策要更加积极有效。今年赤字率拟按3%安排，财政赤字2.38万亿元，比去年增加2000亿元。其中，中央财政赤字1.55万亿元，地方财政赤字8300亿元。安排地方专项债券8000亿元，继续发行地方政府置换债券。今年赤字率保持不变，主要是为了进一步减税降费，全年再减少企业税负3500亿元左右、涉企收费约2000亿元，一定要让市场主体有切身感受。财政预算安排要突出重点、有保有压，加大力度补短板、惠民生。对地方一般性转移支付规模增长9.5%，重点增加均衡性转移支付和困难地区财力补助。压缩非重点支出，减少对绩效不高项目的预算安排。各级政府要坚持过紧日子，中央部门要带头，一律按不低于5%的幅度压减一般性支出，决不允许增加“三公”经费，挤出更多资金用于减税降费，坚守节用裕民的正道。<br/>We will pursue a more proactive and effective fiscal policy. This year's deficit-to-GDP ratio is projected to be 3 percent, with the fiscal deficit set at 2.38 trillion yuan, representing a year-on-year increase of 200 billion yuan. To break this down, the projected deficit of the central government is 1.55 trillion yuan, and the projected deficit of local governments is 830 billion yuan. Local government special bonds to be issued will total 800 billion yuan, and local government bonds will continue to be issued to replace their outstanding debt. The main reason for keeping this year's deficit-to-GDP ratio unchanged is to allow for further reductions in taxes and fees. Over the course of the year, the tax burden on businesses will be further eased by around 350 billion yuan, and business related fees will be further cut by around 200 billion yuan to benefit market entities.<br/>Government budgets should highlight priorities; spending in some areas should be maintained while in others cuts should be made; and more should be spent to strengthen areas of weakness and improve living standards. General transfer payments to local governments will be increased by 9.5 percent, with the focus on increasing transfer payments for equalizing access to basic public services and stepping up subsidies for regions facing economic difficulties. We will scale down non-priority spending and cut budgets for projects that do not deliver desired outcomes.<br/>Governments at all levels should tighten their belts, and central government departments should take the lead by cutting no less than 5 percent of their general expenditures. No increase in spending on official overseas visits, official vehicles, or official hospitality is permitted; and we will squeeze out more funds to cover cuts in taxes and fees. We will keep government spending low and enrich our people.

货币政策要保持稳健中性。今年广义货币M2和社会融资规模余额预期增长均为12%左右。要综合运用货币政策工具，维护流动性基本稳定，合理引导市场利率水平，疏通传导机制，促进金融资源更多流向实体经济，特别是支持“三农”和小微企业。坚持汇率市场化改革方向，保持人民币在全球货币体系中的稳定地位。<br/>We will continue to pursue a prudent and neutral monetary policy. The M2 money supply and aggregate financing are forecasted to grow by around 12 percent in 2017. We will apply a full range of monetary policy instruments, maintain basic stability in liquidity, see that market interest rates remain at an appropriate level, and improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. We will encourage a greater flow of financial resources into the real economy, particularly in support of agriculture, rural areas, and farmers, and small and micro businesses. The RMB exchange rate will be further liberalized, and the currency's stable position in the global monetary system will be maintained.

做好今年政府工作，要把握好以下几点。一是贯彻稳中求进工作总基调，保持战略定力。稳是大局，要着力稳增长、保就业、防风险，守住金融安全、民生保障、环境保护等方面的底线，确保经济社会大局稳定。在稳的前提下要勇于进取，深入推进改革，加快结构调整，敢于啃“硬骨头”，努力在关键领域取得新进展。二是坚持以推进供给侧结构性改革为主线。必须把改善供给侧结构作为主攻方向，通过简政减税、放宽准入、鼓励创新，持续激发微观主体活力，减少无效低效供给、扩大有效供给，更好适应和引导需求。这是一个化蛹成蝶的转型升级过程，既充满希望又伴随阵痛，既非常紧迫又艰巨复杂。要勇往直前，坚决闯过这个关口。三是适度扩大总需求并提高有效性。我国内需潜力巨大，扩内需既有必要也有可能，关键是找准发力点。要围绕改善民生来扩大消费，着眼补短板、增后劲来增加投资，使扩内需更加有效、更可持续，使供给侧改革和需求侧管理相辅相成、相得益彰。四是依靠创新推动新旧动能转换和结构优化升级。我国发展到现在这个阶段，不靠改革创新没有出路。我们拥有世界上数量最多、素质较高的劳动力，有最大规模的科技和专业技能人才队伍，蕴藏着巨大的创新潜能。要坚持以改革开放为动力、以人力人才资源为支撑，加快创新发展，培育壮大新动能、改造提升传统动能，提高全要素生产率，推动经济保持中高速增长、产业迈向中高端水平。五是着力解决人民群众普遍关心的突出问题。政府的一切工作都是为了人民，要践行以人民为中心的发展思想，把握好我国处于社会主义初级阶段的基本国情。对群众反映强烈、期待迫切的问题，有条件的要抓紧解决，把好事办好；一时难以解决的，要努力创造条件逐步加以解决。我们要咬定青山不放松，持之以恒为群众办实事、解难事，促进社会公平正义，把发展硬道理更多体现在增进人民福祉上。<br/>To deliver a good performance this year, we in government should stick to the following guidelines:<br/>First, we should make progress while maintaining stable performance and keep our strategic focus. Stability is of overriding importance. We should ensure stable growth, maintain employment, and prevent risks. To ensure overall economic and social stability we must not allow the redline to be crossed concerning financial security, people's wellbeing, or environmental protection. We should, while maintaining stable performance, endeavor to make progress, deepen reforms, accelerate structural adjustments, be prepared to take on some really tough problems, and push to make progress in key areas.<br/>Second, we should focus on supply-side structural reform. We must give priority to improving supply-side structure. We should streamline administration, reduce taxes, further expand market access, and encourage innovation; and we should keep micro entities energized, reduce ineffective supply while expanding effective supply, and better adapt to and guide demand. Like the struggle from chrysalis to butterfly, this process of transformation and upgrading is filled with promise but also accompanied by great pain; it is urgent, formidable, and complicated. We should press forward with courage and get the job done.<br/>Third, we should expand aggregate demand as appropriate and improve its efficacy. China's potential domestic demand is enormous, and it is both necessary and possible for domestic demand to be expanded. The key is to know where to start. We need to increase consumer spending to improve people's lives, and boost investment to strengthen areas of weakness and sustain development, so that the expansion of domestic demand becomes more effective and sustainable and supply-side reform and demand-side regulation reinforce each other.<br/>Fourth, we should rely on innovation to replace old growth drivers with new ones and speed up structural improvement and upgrading. Having reached the current stage of development, China can now advance only through reform and innovation. We have the largest quality workforce as well as the largest pool of scientists, engineers, and professionals in the world, and their potential for innovation is truly tremendous. We must continue to draw strength from reform and opening up, fully tap the potential of human resources and human capital, and move more quickly to pursue innovation-driven development. We should foster and develop new growth drivers while transforming and upgrading the traditional growth drivers, and increase total factor productivity. These steps will enable China's economy to maintain a medium-high rate of growth and China's industries to move toward the medium-high end.<br/>Fifth, we should solve prominent problems of public concern. All government work is for the people. We should keep in mind the fact that China remains in the primary stage of socialism and pursue a people focused development philosophy. Where conditions permit, we will lose no time in solving problems about which the people have great concern and which demand speedy resolution. When problems cannot be solved for the time being, we will work to resolve them over time. We must make dedicated efforts to deliver services to the people, resolve the difficulties they face, promote social equity and justice, and demonstrate that development does better people's lives.

三、2017年重点工作任务<br/>Major areas of work for 2017

面对今年艰巨繁重的改革发展稳定任务，我们要通观全局、统筹兼顾，突出重点、把握关键，正确处理好各方面关系，着重抓好以下几个方面工作。<br/>Confronted with the formidable tasks of reform and development and maintaining stability this year, we must keep in mind the big picture and adopt a holistic approach, have clear priorities and focus on key tasks, and properly handle interactions among various sectors. We should give priority to the following areas of work.

（一）用改革的办法深入推进“三去一降一补”。要在巩固成果基础上，针对新情况新问题，完善政策措施，努力取得更大成效。<br/>1. Pushing ahead with the five priority tasks through reform<br/>We should, on the basis of consolidating and building on what we have achieved, improve our policies and measures in light of new developments and new problems so as to make greater progress.

扎实有效去产能。今年要再压减钢铁产能5000万吨左右，退出煤炭产能1.5亿吨以上。同时，要淘汰、停建、缓建煤电产能5000万千瓦以上，以防范化解煤电产能过剩风险，提高煤电行业效率，优化能源结构，为清洁能源发展腾空间。要严格执行环保、能耗、质量、安全等相关法律法规和标准，更多运用市场化法治化手段，有效处置“僵尸企业”，推动企业兼并重组、破产清算，坚决淘汰不达标的落后产能，严控过剩行业新上产能。去产能必须安置好职工，中央财政专项奖补资金要及时拨付，地方和企业要落实相关资金与措施，确保分流职工就业有出路、生活有保障。<br/>Take solid and effective steps to cut overcapacity.This year, we will further reduce steel production capacity by around 50 million metric tons and shut down at least 150 million metric tons of coal production facilities. At the same time, we will suspend or postpone construction on or eliminate no less than 50 million kilowatts of coal-fired power generation capacity in order to guard against and defuse the risks of overcapacity in coal-fired power, improve the efficiency of this sector, optimize the energy mix, and make room for clean energy to develop.<br/>We will strictly enforce all laws, regulations, and standards on environmental protection, energy consumption, quality, and safety and make more use of market- and law-based methods as we work to address the problems of "zombie enterprises," encourage enterprise mergers, restructuring, and bankruptcy liquidations, shut down all outdated production facilities that fail to meet standards, and stringently control the launching of new projects in industries that are already saddled with overcapacity.<br/>As overcapacity is cut, we must provide assistance to laid-off workers. Central government special funds for rewards and subsidies should be promptly allocated and local governments and enterprises need to put in place related funds and measures, to ensure that laid-off workers can find new jobs and secure their livelihoods.

因城施策去库存。目前三四线城市房地产库存仍然较多，要支持居民自住和进城人员购房需求。坚持住房的居住属性，落实地方政府主体责任，加快建立和完善促进房地产市场平稳健康发展的长效机制，健全购租并举的住房制度，以市场为主满足多层次需求，以政府为主提供基本保障。加强房地产市场分类调控，房价上涨压力大的城市要合理增加住宅用地，规范开发、销售、中介等行为，遏制热点城市房价过快上涨。目前城镇还有几千万人居住在条件简陋的棚户区，要持续进行改造。今年再完成棚户区住房改造600万套，继续发展公租房等保障性住房，因地制宜、多种方式提高货币化安置比例，加强配套设施建设和公共服务，让更多住房困难家庭告别棚户区，让广大人民群众在住有所居中创造新生活。<br/>Take targeted policies to cut excess urban real estate inventory.At present, there is still excess supply in the real estate markets of third- and fourth-tier cities. We will support both local and new residents in buying homes for personal use.<br/>We need to be clear that housing is for people to live in, and local governments should take primary responsibility in this respect. We should move faster to establish robust long-term mechanisms for promoting the steady and sound development of the real estate sector and build a better housing system that gives equal weight to buying and renting, with multiple levels of demand being met primarily by the market, and basic housing support provided by the government. We will take more category-based and targeted steps to regulate the real estate market. Cities that are under big pressure from rising housing prices need to increase as appropriate the supply of land for residential use. We should better regulate housing development, marketing, and intermediary services, and keep home prices from rising too quickly in popular cities.<br/>Today several dozen million people still live in rundown areas in cities and towns. We must continue housing renovations in these areas. This year, we will renovate another 6 million housing units in these areas, continue to develop public rental housing and other forms of government-subsidized housing, base measures on local circumstances and use multiple means to increase the use of monetary compensation for those affected by such rebuilding, and improve local infrastructure and public services. With these efforts, we will help more families struggling with housing to bid farewell to rundown areas, and see that with good roofs over their heads our people move on to better lives.

积极稳妥去杠杆。我国非金融企业杠杆率较高，这与储蓄率高、以信贷为主的融资结构有关。要在控制总杠杆率的前提下，把降低企业杠杆率作为重中之重。促进企业盘活存量资产，推进资产证券化，支持市场化法治化债转股，发展多层次资本市场，加大股权融资力度，强化企业特别是国有企业财务杠杆约束，逐步将企业负债降到合理水平。<br/>Carry out deleveraging in an active and prudent way.There is high leverage in nonfinancial Chinese firms. This is caused by high savings rates and the composition of financing which is primarily based on credit. While working to control overall leverage, we should focus on bringing down the leverage of enterprises. We need to see that the idle assets of enterprises are put to use, push ahead with securitization of corporate assets, support market- and law-based debt-to-equity swaps, develop the multilevel capital market, expand equity financing, and place tighter constraints on enterprises, especially SOEs, in leveraging, so as to gradually reduce enterprise debt to an acceptable level.

多措并举降成本。扩大小微企业享受减半征收所得税优惠的范围，年应纳税所得额上限由30万元提高到50万元；科技型中小企业研发费用加计扣除比例由50%提高到75%，千方百计使结构性减税力度和效应进一步显现。名目繁多的收费使许多企业不堪重负，要大幅降低非税负担。一是全面清理规范政府性基金，取消城市公用事业附加等基金，授权地方政府自主减免部分基金。二是取消或停征中央涉企行政事业性收费35项，收费项目再减少一半以上，保留的项目要尽可能降低收费标准。各地也要削减涉企行政事业性收费。三是减少政府定价的涉企经营性收费，清理取消行政审批中介服务违规收费，推动降低金融、铁路货运等领域涉企经营性收费，加强对市场调节类经营服务性收费的监管。四是继续适当降低“五险一金”有关缴费比例。五是通过深化改革、完善政策，降低企业制度性交易成本，降低用能、物流等成本。各有关部门和单位都要舍小利顾大义，使企业轻装上阵，创造条件形成我国竞争新优势。<br/>Take multiple measures to cut costs.More small businesses with low profits will enjoy halved corporate income tax, with the upper limit of taxable annual income raised from 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. For small and medium high-tech enterprises, the proportion of R&D expenses covered by the additional tax reduction policy is to be raised from 50 to 75 percent. We will do all we can to see the intensity and impact of structural tax cuts deliver further results. The great number of charges have placed an unbearable burden on many businesses; we are going to slash non-tax burdens.<br/>First, we will completely overhaul government-managed funds, abolish municipal public utility surcharges, and authorize local governments to reduce and cancel some funds.<br/>Second, we will abolish or suspend 35 administrative charges paid by enterprises to the central government, again cutting the number of charges by more than half; and then reduce as far as possible those that still apply. Local governments also need to make significant cuts to government administrative fees.<br/>Third, we will reduce government-set operating fees for businesses. Unauthorized fees charged by intermediaries for government review and approval will be overhauled or abolished. We will work toward lower operating fees levied on businesses in the finance and railway freight sectors. We will strengthen oversight over the collection of market-set service fees.<br/>Fourth, we will continue to lower as appropriate the share paid by enterprises for contributions to social security.<br/>Fifth, we will deepen reforms and improve policies to reduce government imposed transaction costs for businesses and lower their energy and logistics costs.<br/>All government departments and agencies concerned should have in mind the overall interests of the country instead of their narrow departmental interests, reduce the financial burden on enterprises, and help them develop new advantages over international competition.

精准加力补短板。要针对严重制约经济社会发展和民生改善的突出问题，结合实施“十三五”规划确定的重大项目，加大补短板力度，加快提升公共服务、基础设施、创新发展、资源环境等支撑能力。<br/>Take targeted and powerful measures to strengthen areas of weakness.We need to focus on salient problems that are holding back economic and social development and making it difficult to improve people's standards of living, and we should integrate efforts to undertake major projects set out in the 13th Five-Year Plan with efforts to strengthen areas of weakness. We should act faster to raise the capacity of public services, infrastructure, innovation-driven development, and resources and the environment to sustain development.

贫困地区和贫困人口是全面建成小康社会最大的短板。要深入实施精准扶贫精准脱贫，今年再减少农村贫困人口1000万以上，完成易地扶贫搬迁340万人。中央财政专项扶贫资金增长30%以上。加强集中连片特困地区、革命老区、边疆和民族地区开发，改善基础设施和公共服务，推动特色产业发展、劳务输出、教育和健康扶贫，做好因病等致贫返贫群众帮扶，实施贫困村整体提升工程，增强贫困地区和贫困群众自我发展能力。推进贫困县涉农资金整合，强化资金和项目监管。创新扶贫协作机制，支持和引导社会力量参与扶贫。切实落实脱贫攻坚责任制，实施最严格的评估考核，严肃查处假脱贫、“被脱贫”、数字脱贫，确保脱贫得到群众认可、经得起历史检验。<br/>Poor areas and people living in poverty represent the area of greatest weakness we must face as we work to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. We need to do more in implementing targeted poverty reduction and elimination measures. This year we will further reduce the number of rural residents living in poverty by over 10 million, including 3.4 million to be relocated from inhospitable areas. Central government funding for poverty alleviation will be increased by over 30 percent.<br/>We need to step up development in contiguous areas of extreme poverty, old revolutionary bases, border areas, and areas with concentrations of ethnic minorities. For this we should focus on the following work: improving infrastructure and public services; fostering poverty alleviation through distinctive local businesses, the domestic and overseas export of labor, and improving education and health care; providing assistance to people who become poor or sink back into poverty due to illness; implementing the program for improving life in poor villages; and building the self-development capacity of poor areas and people.<br/>In poor counties, different rural development funds will be merged, and oversight over funds and projects will be strengthened. We will develop new mechanisms for coordinating poverty reduction efforts. We will support and guide non-governmental participation in combating poverty. The system for ensuring responsibility is taken for poverty elimination will be effectively enforced, the strictest possible evaluations and assessments of poverty alleviation will be carried out, and stern measures will be taken to address deception, falsification, and the manipulation of numbers in poverty elimination work. We must see that the results of our poverty elimination earn the approval of our people and stand the test of time.

（二）深化重要领域和关键环节改革。要全面深化各领域改革，加快推进基础性、关键性改革，增强内生发展动力。<br/>2. Deepening reform in major sectors and key links<br/>Full reform will be deepened in all areas. We will move faster to advance fundamental and critical reforms to boost the internal forces driving development.

持续推进政府职能转变。使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用和更好发挥政府作用，必须深化简政放权、放管结合、优化服务改革。这是政府自身的一场深刻革命，要继续以壮士断腕的勇气，坚决披荆斩棘向前推进。全面实行清单管理制度，制定国务院部门权力和责任清单，加快扩大市场准入负面清单试点，减少政府的自由裁量权，增加市场的自主选择权。清理取消一批生产和服务许可证。深化商事制度改革，实行多证合一，扩大“证照分离”改革试点。完善事中事后监管制度，实现“双随机、一公开”监管全覆盖，推进综合行政执法。加快国务院部门和地方政府信息系统互联互通，形成全国统一政务服务平台。我们一定要让企业和群众更多感受到“放管服”改革成效，着力打通“最后一公里”，坚决除烦苛之弊、施公平之策、开便利之门。<br/>We will continue to transform government functions.To enable the market to play the decisive role in resource allocation and to give better play to the role of government, we must deepen reforms to streamline government administration, delegate more powers, and improve regulation and service. This is a profound reform of government itself, which we need to continue to pursue with the courage to make painful self-adjustments and overcome all odds.<br/>We will fully implement the list-based management system, formulate lists of powers and responsibilities of the departments under the State Council, accelerate the extension of trials of granting market access on the basis of a negative list, and reduce the discretionary powers of the government while giving the market more freedom to take its course.

We will strengthen national defense education among the general public, and step up national defense mobilization and readiness of reserve forces. We will continue to promote coordinated, balanced, and compatible development of the economy and national defense, deepen structural reform of defense-related science and technology industries, and intensify military-civilian integration.<br/>We at every level of government should take more solid and vigorous steps to support the reform and development of our national defense and armed forces.

We will draw up a plan for the development of a city cluster in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, give full play to the distinctive strengths of Hong Kong and Macao, and elevate their positions and roles in China's economic development and opening up. We have always had full confidence about ensuring lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao.

People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits should keep in mind the greater interests of the nation, firmly advance peaceful reunification of China, and jointly create better lives and a bright future for all Chinese.
