今年的报告总算没那么长，感谢作者们的关怀。。。

值得一提的是，李克强总理 2022.3.11 上午在十三届全国人大五次会议闭幕后，在人民大会堂三楼金色大厅出席了一个记者会，中间有段问答让我心生感慨：

> 新加坡联合早报记者：<br/>今年是本届中国政府的收官之年。回顾过去四年多的历程，您认为本届政府取得的成绩有哪些？遇到的最大挑战又是什么？在本届政府的最后一年里，中国经济面临着前所未有的压力，您将重点实施哪些政策？以更好地稳定社会信心、回应民众的关切。谢谢。
> 
> 李克强：<br/>本届政府以来，国际形势复杂多变，国内矛盾和困难叠加。说到最大的挑战，那还是新冠疫情及其给经济带来的严重冲击。我们志不求易、事不避难、行不避险，尽了最大努力。
> 
> 记得我出任总理时在这里召开第一次记者会，也就是在这个大厅里边，就明确表明，要持续发展经济、不断改善民生、促进社会公正，这是我们政府的基本任务，行大道、民为本、利天下，就是要以民之所望为施政所向。这些年，我们锲而不舍、一以贯之，创新施政方式，用保持经济运行在合理区间等方式来应对周期性的经济波动，尤其是把宏观政策的实施直面市场主体的需求；坚定推进改革，减除繁苛，维护公正，培育和壮大市场主体和新动能，激发市场活力和社会创造力；坚持就业优先，把握国情实际，注重保障基本民生，等等。政府工作有人民群众认可的地方，也有与他们的期盼有差距和不足的地方，这些我们是清楚的。
> 
> 至于你说到今年是本届政府的最后一年，也是我担任总理的最后一年。我们所面临的形势依然复杂严峻，困难和挑战依然众多，我在政府工作报告和刚才回答问题中已经对应对困难挑战作了说明和阐述。我和我的同事们，会以锲而不舍的精神恪尽职守，用实干来践行承诺。
> 
> 我相信，在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，有社会各界的大力支持，特别是人民群众的共同奋斗，中国经济一定能够爬坡过坎，实现今年全年经济社会发展的主要目标任务，并为以后的发展奠定应有的坚实基础。谢谢。

今年是本届政府的最后一年、李克强出任总理的最后一年，应该也是我最后一年看政工报告，虽然以后还是会热爱英语言文学、热爱生活、热爱祖国。

希望我们每个普通人，当然了，也是对我自己的一个要求，都能做到“志不求易、事不避难、行不避险”，锲而不舍，笃行不怠，真真正正尽了最大努力。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>一、2021年工作回顾</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I. A Review of Our Work in 2021</strong>

Last year, facing complicated and challenging circumstances both in and outside of China, as well as many risks and challenges, all of us throughout the country worked hard as one. We responded to Covid-19 and pursued economic and social development in a well-coordinated way, accomplished the main targets and tasks for the year, got the 14th Five-Year Plan off to a good start, and once again secured new and major achievements in our country’s development.

—The economy continued to recover and grow. China’s gross domestic product (GDP) reached 114 trillion yuan, growing 8.1 percent. National fiscal revenue exceeded 20 trillion yuan, growing 10.7 percent. A total of 12.69 million urban jobs were added, and the average surveyed unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent.

By making these efforts, we ensured the health and safety of the people and maintained normal order in work and life.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;回顾过去一年，成绩得来殊为不易。我国经济尚处在突发疫情等严重冲击后的恢复发展过程中，国内外形势又出现很多新变化，保持经济平稳运行难度加大。我们深入贯彻以习近平同志为核心的党中央决策部署，贯彻落实中央经济工作会议精神，完整、准确、全面贯彻新发展理念，扎实做好“六稳”、“六保”工作，注重宏观政策跨周期和逆周期调节，有效应对各种风险挑战，主要做了以下工作。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on the past year, we can see that our achievements did not come easily. While the economy continued to recover from major shocks including Covid-19, many new changes occurred in and outside of China, and the difficulty of keeping the economy running stably mounted. In the face of such difficulty, we fully implemented the decisions and plans of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, followed the guiding principles of the Central Economic Work Conference; applied the new development philosophy in full, in the right way, and in all fields of endeavor; took solid steps to ensure stability on six key fronts and security in six key areas, and made cross- and counter-cyclical adjustments with macro policies. We thus effectively dealt with all risks and challenges that arose.<br/>Our main work over the past year was as follows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;一是保持宏观政策连续性针对性，推动经济运行保持在合理区间。宏观政策适应跨周期调节需要，保持对经济恢复必要支持力度，同时考虑为今年应对困难挑战预留政策空间。建立常态化财政资金直达机制，将2.8万亿元中央财政资金纳入直达范围。优化地方政府专项债券发行使用。有效实施稳健的货币政策，两次全面降准，推动降低贷款利率。有序推进地方政府债务风险防范化解，稳妥处置重大金融风险事件。强化稳岗扩就业政策落实，扎实做好高校毕业生等重点群体就业工作，推进大众创业万众创新。加强大宗商品保供稳价，着力解决煤炭电力供应紧张问题。从全年看，主要宏观经济指标符合预期，财政赤字率和宏观杠杆率下降，经济增速继续位居世界前列。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.We kept macro policy consistent and targeted and kept the major economic indicators within the appropriate range.<br/>Our macro policies facilitated cross-cyclical adjustments and sustained the level of support necessary for economic recovery. We also took into account the need to leave ample policy space for meeting difficulties and challenges this year.<br/>We established a regular mechanism to directly allocate budgetary funds to prefecture- and county-level governments and placed 2.8 trillion yuan of central government funding under this mechanism. We also improved the way local governments issue and use special-purpose bonds.<br/>We implemented a prudent monetary policy to good effect and lowered required reserve ratios twice to facilitate the reduction of loan interest rates. We took well-considered steps to defuse local government debt risks and dealt prudently with major financial risks. We intensified policies to stabilize and expand employment, took solid measures to ensure employment for key groups like college graduates, and encouraged business startups and innovation. We took stronger steps to keep supply and prices of major commodities stable and to tackle supply shortages in coal and electric power.<br/>Over the course of last year, all major macroeconomic indicators stayed in line with projected targets, the deficit-to-GDP ratio and macro leverage ratio decreased, and China’s economy remained one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;二是优化和落实助企纾困政策，巩固经济恢复基础。上亿市场主体承载着数亿人就业创业，宏观政策延续疫情发生以来行之有效的支持路径和做法。去年新增减税降费超过1万亿元，还对制造业中小微企业、煤电和供热企业实施阶段性缓缴税费。实践表明，减税降费是助企纾困直接有效的办法，实际上也是“放水养鱼”、涵养税源，2013年以来新增的涉税市场主体去年纳税达到4.76万亿元。加强铁路、公路、航空、海运、港口等运输保障。加大对受疫情影响严重行业企业信贷投放，继续执行小微企业贷款延期还本付息和信用贷款支持政策，银行业金融机构普惠小微企业贷款增长27.3%，大型商业银行普惠小微企业贷款增幅超过40%，企业综合融资成本稳中有降。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We refined and implemented policies for easing the difficulties of businesses and consolidated the foundation of economic recovery.<br/>As over one hundred million market entities have given several hundred million people the opportunity to go into business or secure employment, we have continued with the supportive macro-policy roadmaps and approaches that have proved effective since the epidemic began.<br/>Tax and fee reductions introduced last year totaled more than one trillion yuan. In addition, tax payments were postponed for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in manufacturing as well as coal-fired power plants and heating-supply enterprises as a temporary measure. Tax and fee reductions have proved a direct and effective way of helping enterprises ease their difficulties. In reality, they also help nurture business growth and cultivate sources of tax revenue. Last year, revenue generated from taxpaying market entities registered since 2013 reached 4.76 trillion yuan.<br/>We strengthened the capacity of railway, highway, aviation and maritime transportation as well as harbors. We boosted the credit supply to industries and enterprises severely affected by Covid-19. We continued policies for micro and small businesses to defer principal and interest repayments on loans and take out more collateral-free loans. Inclusive finance lending to micro and small business by financial institutions increased by 27.3 percent, with the figure rising to over 40 percent for large commercial banks, and overall financing costs of businesses dropped steadily.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;三是深化改革扩大开放，持续改善营商环境。加强市场体系基础制度建设，推进要素市场化配置等改革。继续压减涉企审批手续和办理时限，更多政务服务事项实现一网通办。推广一批地方改革经验，开展营商环境创新试点。加强和创新监管，反垄断和防止资本无序扩张，维护公平竞争。深入实施国企改革三年行动。支持民营企业健康发展。基本完成行业协会商会与行政机关脱钩改革。设立北京证券交易所和广州期货交易所。稳步推进农业农村、社会事业、生态文明等领域改革。深化共建“一带一路”务实合作。加大稳外贸稳外资力度，成功举办进博会、广交会、服贸会及首届消博会等重大展会。新增4个服务业扩大开放综合试点，推出海南自由贸易港开放新举措。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We deepened reform, expanded opening up, and continued to improve the business environment.<br/>We worked harder to develop the underlying institutions for a market system, and pushed forward reforms to ensure production factors are allocated by the market. We continued to reduce the number of procedures and length of time it takes for enterprises to gain government approval. More government services were made available online. A package of successful practices in local reform were applied nationwide, and trials were conducted to improve the business environment.<br/>We bolstered regulation and adopted new regulatory approaches, took action against business monopolies, and prevented the unregulated expansion of capital, thus ensuring fair market competition. We continued implementation of the three-year action plan for SOE reform and supported the healthy development of private businesses. The reform to delink industry associations and chambers of commerce from government was basically completed. The Beijing Stock Exchange and Guangzhou Futures Exchange were opened. Solid strides were made in reforms in agriculture, rural development, social programs, and ecological conservation.<br/>We deepened practical cooperation to jointly advance the Belt and Road Initiative. Efforts to ensure stable performance in foreign trade and investment were intensified. We successfully hosted a number of major expos, including the China International Import Expo, the China Import and Export Fair, the China International Fair for Trade in Services, and the first China International Consumer Products Expo. Comprehensive trials for further opening up of the services sector were expanded to four more areas, and new measures for developing the Hainan Free Trade Port were adopted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;四是强化创新引领，稳定产业链供应链。加强国家实验室建设，推进重大科技项目实施。改革完善中央财政科研经费管理，提高间接费用比例，扩大科研自主权。延续实施研发费用加计扣除政策，将制造业企业研发费用加计扣除比例提高到100%。强化知识产权保护。开展重点产业强链补链行动。传统产业数字化智能化改造加快，新兴产业保持良好发展势头。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We promoted innovation-driven development and stabilized industrial and supply chains.<br/>We boosted the development of national laboratories and promoted implementation of major science and technology programs. We reformed and refined the management of central government funding for scientific and technological research, increased the proportion of indirect expenses for research projects, and gave institutes more decision-making power over their research.<br/>We continued the additional tax deduction for R&D expenses and increased this deduction to cover 100 percent of such expenses for manufacturing enterprises. Intellectual property right protection was strengthened. Weak links in the industrial chains of key industries were reinforced and upgraded. Digital and smart technologies were adopted in traditional industries at a faster rate, and emerging industries maintained good momentum for development.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;五是推动城乡区域协调发展，不断优化经济布局。落实区域重大战略和区域协调发展战略，出台新的支持举措，实施一批重大项目。推进以县城为重要载体的城镇化建设。加强农业生产，保障农资供应，对种粮农民一次性发放200亿元补贴。推动乡村振兴，确定160个国家乡村振兴重点帮扶县。实施农村人居环境整治提升五年行动。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We promoted coordinated development between urban and rural areas and between regions and improved the structure of the economy.<br/>To ensure implementation of all major regional development strategies and the strategy for coordinated regional development, we rolled out new supporting measures and launched several major projects. Urbanization with the focus on county seats was promoted. To help bolster agricultural production, we ensured agricultural supplies and issued one-time subsidies totaling 20 billion yuan to grain growers.<br/>We advanced rural revitalization and designated 160 key counties to receive assistance in pursuing rural revitalization. A five-year program to improve the rural living environment also got under way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;六是加强生态环境保护，促进可持续发展。巩固蓝天、碧水、净土保卫战成果。推动化肥农药减量增效和畜禽养殖废弃物资源化利用。持续推进生态保护修复重大工程，全面实施长江十年禁渔。可再生能源发电装机规模突破10亿千瓦。出台碳达峰行动方案。启动全国碳排放权交易市场。积极应对气候变化。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We strengthened environmental protection and promoted sustainable development.<br/>We consolidated our gains in keeping the skies blue, waters clear, and land pollution-free. We encouraged farmers to use chemical fertilizer and pesticide more efficiently and promoted the recycling of livestock and poultry waste. We continued major projects to protect and restore ecosystems, and fully enforced the ten-year fishing ban on the Yangtze River.<br/>China’s installed capacity of renewable power exceeded one billion kilowatts. An action plan for peaking carbon emissions by 2030 was unveiled. The China Carbon Emission Trade Exchange was launched. We took active steps to respond to climate change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;七是着力保障和改善民生，加快发展社会事业。加大农村义务教育薄弱环节建设力度，提高学生营养改善计划补助标准，3700多万学生受益。减轻义务教育阶段学生作业负担和校外培训负担。超额完成高职扩招三年行动目标。国家助学贷款每人每年最高额度增加4000元，惠及500多万在校生。上调退休人员基本养老金。提高优抚标准。将低保边缘家庭重病重残人员纳入低保范围，做好困难群众帮扶救助。改革疾病预防控制体系。把更多常见病、慢性病等门诊费用纳入医保报销范围，住院费用跨省直接结算率达到60%。严格药品疫苗监管。实施三孩生育政策。加强养老服务。加快发展保障性租赁住房。繁荣发展文化事业和文化产业，创新实施文化惠民工程。营造良好网络生态。积极开展全民健身运动。我国体育健儿在东京奥运会、残奥会上勇创佳绩。经过精心筹备，我们成功举办了简约、安全、精彩的北京冬奥会，也一定能办好刚刚开幕的冬残奥会。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We worked to ensure and improve the people’s wellbeing and accelerated development of social programs.<br/>We intensified efforts to shore up weak links in rural compulsory education, and increased subsidies in the nutrition improvement program for compulsory-education students in rural areas, benefiting over 37 million students. We reduced the homework load and eased the off-campus tutoring burden on students in compulsory education. We surpassed the targets set in the three-year enrollment expansion initiative for vocational colleges. The cap for government-subsidized student loans was raised by 4,000 yuan per person per year, benefiting over five million students.<br/>The basic pension for retirees was increased. Benefits were raised for entitled groups. To improve assistance and support for those in need, the scope of the subsistence allowance scheme was expanded to include people with serious illness or severe disability from families just outside the margin of eligibility.<br/>We reformed the system for disease prevention and control. Outpatient bills for more common illnesses and chronic diseases became reimbursable under the basic medical insurance scheme, and 60 percent of cross-provincial inpatient medical expenses were directly settled where they were incurred. We tightened up regulation and supervision of drugs and vaccines.<br/>The three-child policy was implemented. Elderly services were improved. Government-subsidized rental housing was increased at a faster pace. We developed cultural programs and the cultural sector, and launched new cultural projects to benefit the public. A sound online environment was fostered.<br/>We actively carried out public fitness activities. Chinese athletes achieved great success in the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo. And thanks to meticulous preparation, China has presented the world with a simple, safe, and splendid 2022 Winter Olympic Games. The Paralympic Games, which has just opened, will undoubtedly also be a great success.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;八是推进法治政府建设和治理创新，保持社会和谐稳定。提请全国人大常委会审议法律议案10件，制定修订行政法规15部。认真办理人大代表建议和政协委员提案。出台法治政府建设实施纲要。发挥审计监督作用。继续开展国务院大督查，深入实施“互联网+督查”。创新城乡基层治理。扎实做好信访工作，化解信访积案。强化安全生产和应急管理。加强国家安全保障能力建设。完善社会治安防控体系，常态化开展扫黑除恶斗争，集中打击治理电信网络诈骗等犯罪。去年一些地区发生严重洪涝等灾害，各方面积极开展防灾救灾和灾后重建，努力保障人民群众生命财产安全。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;中国特色大国外交全面推进。习近平主席等党和国家领导人通过视频方式出席联合国大会、二十国集团领导人峰会、亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议、金砖国家领导人会晤、中国－东盟建立对话关系30周年纪念峰会、中非合作论坛部长级会议开幕式、东亚合作领导人系列会议、亚欧首脑会议等重大活动。成功举办多场重大主场外交活动。推动构建人类命运共同体，积极发展全球伙伴关系，积极参与全球治理体系改革和建设，推进国际抗疫合作，共同应对全球性问题和挑战。中国为促进世界和平与发展作出了积极贡献。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We made progress in building a rule of law government, developed new ways of conducting governance, and maintained social harmony and stability.<br/>We submitted 10 legislative proposals to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC) for deliberation, and formulated or revised 15 sets of administrative regulations. We conscientiously handled the proposals of NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members. The Outline for Building a Law-Based Government (2021–2025) was promulgated. Audit-based oversight was enhanced. The State Council continued its accountability inspections, and further implemented the Internet plus model of inspection. New approaches were adopted in conducting primary-level governance in urban and rural areas. We made solid headway in handling public complaints and clearing the backlog of cases.<br/>We took stronger steps to ensure workplace safety and strengthened emergency response management. Our ability to safeguard national security was enhanced. We improved the crime prevention and control system, worked to crack down on organized crime and root out local criminal gangs on an ongoing basis, and fought telecom and cyber fraud as a priority. During severe flooding and other disasters that hit some parts of the country last year, government authorities and departments were actively involved in disaster prevention, relief, and reconstruction and earnestly strived to protect people’s lives and property.<br/>We implemented the Party Central Committee’s strategic decision to exercise full and strict Party self-governance. We carried out activities to study the history of the CPC, and did more to improve Party conduct, build a government of integrity, and fight corruption. We strictly complied with the central Party leadership’s eight-point decision on improving work conduct, kept up our efforts to tackle pointless formalities, bureaucratism, hedonism and extravagance, and took further steps to ease the burdens of those working on the ground.<br/>We advanced China’s major-country diplomacy on all fronts. President Xi Jinping and other Party and state leaders attended, via video link, major diplomatic events, including the 76th UN General Assembly, the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit, the 28th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, the 13th BRICS Summit, the Special Summit to Commemorate the 30th Anniversary of China-ASEAN Dialogue Relations, the opening ceremony of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the East Asia leaders’ meetings on cooperation and the 13th Asia-Europe Meeting. We also successfully hosted a number of major diplomatic events.<br/>We promoted the building of a human community with a shared future, fostered global partnerships, and played an active part in the reform and development of the global governance system. We advanced international cooperation on Covid-19 response and worked with all other countries to respond to issues and challenges global in nature. We have thus contributed our share to promoting world peace and development.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;各位代表！

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;过去一年取得的成绩，是以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导的结果，是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想科学指引的结果，是全党全军全国各族人民团结奋斗的结果。我代表国务院，向全国各族人民，向各民主党派、各人民团体和各界人士，表示诚挚感谢！向香港特别行政区同胞、澳门特别行政区同胞、台湾同胞和海外侨胞，表示诚挚感谢！向关心和支持中国现代化建设的各国政府、国际组织和各国朋友，表示诚挚感谢！

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;在肯定成绩的同时，我们也清醒看到面临的问题和挑战。全球疫情仍在持续，世界经济复苏动力不足，大宗商品价格高位波动，外部环境更趋复杂严峻和不确定。我国经济发展面临需求收缩、供给冲击、预期转弱三重压力。局部疫情时有发生。消费和投资恢复迟缓，稳出口难度增大，能源原材料供应仍然偏紧，输入性通胀压力加大，中小微企业、个体工商户生产经营困难，稳就业任务更加艰巨。关键领域创新支撑能力不强。一些地方财政收支矛盾加大，经济金融领域风险隐患较多。民生领域还有不少短板。政府工作存在不足，形式主义、官僚主义仍然突出，脱离实际、违背群众意愿现象屡有发生，有的在政策执行中采取“一刀切”、运动式做法。少数干部不担当、不作为、乱作为，有的漠视严重侵害群众权益问题、工作严重失职失责。一些领域腐败问题依然多发。我们要增强忧患意识，直面问题挑战，全力以赴做好工作，决不辜负人民期待！

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellow Deputies,<br/>We owe our achievements last year to the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the sound guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and the concerted efforts of the Party, the armed forces and Chinese people of all ethnic groups.<br/>On behalf of the State Council, I wish to express sincere gratitude to all our people, and to all other political parties, people’s organizations, and public figures from all sectors of society. I express heartfelt appreciation to our fellow countrymen and women in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, in Taiwan, and overseas. I also wish to express heartfelt thanks to the governments of other countries, international organizations and friends across the world who have shown understanding and support for us in China as we pursue modernization.<br/>While recognizing our achievements, we are also very clear about the problems and challenges before us.<br/>The Covid-19 pandemic is still ongoing. The world economic recovery lacks drive, and commodity prices remain high and are prone to fluctuation. All of this is making our external environment increasingly volatile, grave and uncertain.<br/>In pursing economic development, China is under the triple pressures of shrinking demand, disrupted supply and weakening expectations. Local Covid-19 cases are still occurring sporadically. The recovery of consumption and investment is sluggish. It is getting more difficult to maintain steady growth in exports, the supply of energy resources and raw materials remains inadequate, and imported inflationary pressure has increased. Many MSMEs and self-employed individuals face difficulty in production and business operations, and the task of stabilizing employment is more formidable. Our capacity to support innovation is lacking in key areas. The budgetary imbalances of some local governments have become more pronounced, and many potential risks are present in the economic and financial sectors. In areas that are important to the public wellbeing, numerous issues need to be addressed.<br/>There is also room for improvement in the work of government. Pointless formalities and bureaucratism remain an acute issue. Cases of becoming detached from reality and acting against the public will are still frequent. Some local governments use one-size-fits-all or campaign-style approaches in policy implementation. A small number of officials either shirk their responsibilities, fail to do their jobs, or behave irresponsibly. Some officials, by disregarding serious infringements on the rights and interests of the people, have been derelict in their duties. Corruption remains a common problem in some sectors.<br/>We must be more mindful of potential difficulties, face problems and challenges squarely, make every effort to deliver a satisfactory performance, and do our utmost to live up to people’s expectations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>二、2022年经济社会发展总体要求和政策取向</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>II. Overall Requirements and Policy Orientation for</strong><br/><strong>Economic and Social Development in 2022</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;今年将召开中国共产党第二十次全国代表大会，是党和国家事业发展进程中十分重要的一年。做好政府工作，要在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，全面贯彻落实党的十九大和十九届历次全会精神，弘扬伟大建党精神，坚持稳中求进工作总基调，完整、准确、全面贯彻新发展理念，加快构建新发展格局，全面深化改革开放，坚持创新驱动发展，推动高质量发展，坚持以供给侧结构性改革为主线，统筹疫情防控和经济社会发展，统筹发展和安全，继续做好“六稳”、“六保”工作，持续改善民生，着力稳定宏观经济大盘，保持经济运行在合理区间，保持社会大局稳定，迎接党的二十大胜利召开。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;综合研判国内外形势，今年我国发展面临的风险挑战明显增多，必须爬坡过坎。越是困难越要坚定信心、越要真抓实干。我国经济长期向好的基本面不会改变，持续发展具有多方面有利条件，特别是亿万人民有追求美好生活的强烈愿望、创业创新的巨大潜能、共克时艰的坚定意志，我们还积累了应对重大风险挑战的丰富经验。中国经济一定能顶住新的下行压力，必将行稳致远。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year is of great significance in the cause of the Party and the country, as the Communist Party of China will hold its 20th National Congress. For the government to deliver, we must, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, do the following:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implement the guiding principles of the Party’s 19th National Congress and all plenary sessions of the 19th Party Central Committee;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry forward the great founding spirit of the Party;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;act on the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apply the new development philosophy in full, in the right way, and in all fields of endeavor and move faster to create a new pattern of development;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deepen reform and opening up in all respects;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursue innovation-driven development;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promote high-quality development;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advance supply-side structural reform as the main task;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respond to Covid-19 and pursue economic and social development in a well-coordinated way;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensure both development and security;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue to ensure stability on six key fronts and maintain security in six key areas;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep working to improve people’s lives;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strive to maintain stable macroeconomic performance;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep major economic indicators within an appropriate range; and<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintain overall social stability.

These efforts will enable us to pave the way for a successful 20th National Party Congress.<br/>A comprehensive analysis of evolving dynamics at home and abroad indicates that this year our country will encounter many more risks and challenges, and we must keep pushing to overcome them. The harder things get, the more confident we must be, and the more solid steps we must take to deliver outcomes.<br/>The fundamentals of our economy remain unchanged, and they will maintain long-term growth. We have many favorable conditions for sustaining development. Most notably, our people, in their hundreds of millions, aspire to a better life, have huge potential for starting businesses and engaging in innovation, and are resolved to overcome all difficulties together. We have also acquired a wealth of experience in dealing with major risks and challenges. There is no doubt but that China’s economy will withstand any new downward pressure and continue growing steadily long into the future.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;今年发展主要预期目标是：国内生产总值增长5.5%左右；城镇新增就业1100万人以上，城镇调查失业率全年控制在5.5%以内；居民消费价格涨幅3%左右；居民收入增长与经济增长基本同步；进出口保稳提质，国际收支基本平衡；粮食产量保持在1.3万亿斤以上；生态环境质量持续改善，主要污染物排放量继续下降；能耗强度目标在“十四五”规划期内统筹考核，并留有适当弹性，新增可再生能源和原料用能不纳入能源消费总量控制。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;经济增速预期目标的设定，主要考虑稳就业保民生防风险的需要，并同近两年平均经济增速以及“十四五”规划目标要求相衔接。这是高基数上的中高速增长，体现了主动作为，需要付出艰苦努力才能实现。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;完成今年发展目标任务，宏观政策要稳健有效，微观政策要持续激发市场主体活力，结构政策要着力畅通国民经济循环，科技政策要扎实落地，改革开放政策要激活发展动力，区域政策要增强发展的平衡性协调性，社会政策要兜住兜牢民生底线。各方面要围绕贯彻这些重大政策和要求，细化实化具体举措，形成推动发展的合力。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;要保持宏观政策连续性，增强有效性。积极的财政政策要提升效能，更加注重精准、可持续。稳健的货币政策要灵活适度，保持流动性合理充裕。就业优先政策要提质加力。政策发力适当靠前，及时动用储备政策工具，确保经济平稳运行。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;继续做好常态化疫情防控。坚持外防输入、内防反弹，不断优化完善防控措施，加强口岸城市疫情防控，加大对病毒变异的研究和防范力度，加快新型疫苗和特效药物研发，持续做好疫苗接种工作，更好发挥中医药独特作用，科学精准处置局部疫情，保持正常生产生活秩序。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;今年工作要坚持稳字当头、稳中求进。面对新的下行压力，要把稳增长放在更加突出的位置。各地区各部门要切实担负起稳定经济的责任，积极推出有利于经济稳定的政策。要统筹稳增长、调结构、推改革，加快转变发展方式，不搞粗放型发展。坚持实事求是，立足社会主义初级阶段基本国情，着力办好自己的事，尊重发展规律、客观实际和群众需求，因地制宜创造性开展工作，把各方面干事创业积极性充分调动起来。推动有效市场和有为政府更好结合，善于运用改革创新办法，激发市场活力和社会创造力。要坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，依靠共同奋斗，扎实推进共同富裕，不断实现人民对美好生活的向往。

The main projected targets for development this year are as follows:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GDP growth of around 5.5 percent<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over 11 million new urban jobs<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a surveyed urban unemployment rate of no more than 5.5 percent<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPI increase of around 3 percent<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growth in personal income that is basically in step with economic growth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steady increases in both the volume and quality of imports and exports<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a basic equilibrium in the balance of payments<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grain output of over 650 million metric tons<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further improvement in the environment<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continued reduction in the discharge of major pollutants<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;energy consumption per unit of GDP to be assessed with appropriate flexibility within the framework of the 14th Five-Year Plan; and the exclusion of newly added renewable energy and coal, petroleum, and natural gas consumed as raw materials in the total amount of energy consumption.

The above economic growth target is based mainly on the need to maintain stable employment, meet basic living needs, and guard against risks. This target is also in keeping with the average growth rates of the last two years and the goals of the 14th Five-Year Plan. It represents a medium-high rate of growth given our large economic aggregate, and demonstrates our ability to move proactively. But achieving this goal will require arduous efforts.<br/>To fulfill the development goals and tasks for the year, we should pursue prudent and effective macro policies, micro policies that can continuously energize market entities, and structural policies that facilitate smooth flows in the economy. Science and technology policies should be fully implemented, reform and opening up policies should lend impetus to development, regional policies should ensure more balanced and coordinated development, and social policies should meet basic living needs. All of us involved must adopt detailed and effective measures to meet these major policy requirements and create synergy for driving growth.<br/>Macro policies should be kept consistent and made more effective. The proactive fiscal policy should be more effectual, more targeted, and more sustainable. The prudent monetary policy should be both flexible and appropriate, with reasonably ample liquidity being maintained. The employment-first policy should be pursued with intensified efforts to deliver the desired outcomes. These policies should produce effects early on, and the policy tools we have in reserve should be promptly deployed to ensure stable economic performance.<br/>We will continue effective routine Covid-19 control. To prevent inbound cases and domestic resurgences, we need to constantly refine epidemic containment measures, strengthen epidemic controls in port-of-entry cities, step up efforts to study and protect against virus variants, accelerate R&D of new vaccines and effective medicines, continue implementing vaccination programs, and give full play to the unique role of traditional Chinese medicine. Occurrences of local cases must be handled in a scientific and targeted manner, and the normal order of work and life must be ensured.<br/>In our work this year, we must make economic stability our top priority and pursue progress while ensuring stability. In the face of new downward pressure, the task of ensuring stable growth needs to occupy an even more prominent position. All localities and government departments should fulfill their responsibilities for maintaining stable macroeconomic performance by proactively introducing pro-stability policies.<br/>We should take coordinated moves to keep growth stable, promote structural adjustment, and carry out reform. We should work faster to transform the growth model, and say no to an extensive development model. We should follow a fact-based approach, and bear in mind the fundamental dimension of China’s national context, that is, it is still in the primary stage of socialism. We should manage our own affairs well, and respect the laws of development, the reality on the ground, and the needs of the people.<br/>We should work in creative ways in light of actual conditions and motivate all stakeholders to pursue development endeavors. We should promote both an efficient market and a well-functioning government, and we should be adept at using reform and innovation to boost market dynamism and social creativity. We must act on the people-centered development philosophy and rely on the efforts of everyone to promote prosperity for all, so as to keep realizing the people’s aspirations for a better life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>三、2022年政府工作任务</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>III. Major Tasks for 2022</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;今年经济社会发展任务重、挑战多。要按照以习近平同志为核心的党中央部署要求，完整、准确、全面贯彻新发展理念，加快构建新发展格局，推动高质量发展，扎实做好各项工作。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, we face heavy tasks and many challenges in economic and social development. We should follow the decisions and requirements of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, apply the new development philosophy in full, in the right way, and in all fields of endeavor, move faster to create a new pattern of development, and promote high-quality development, so as to deliver solid outcomes in all areas of our work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;（一）着力稳定宏观经济大盘，保持经济运行在合理区间。继续做好“六稳”、“六保”工作。宏观政策有空间有手段，要强化跨周期和逆周期调节，为经济平稳运行提供有力支撑。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;提升积极的财政政策效能。今年赤字率拟按2.8%左右安排、比去年有所下调，有利于增强财政可持续性。预计今年财政收入继续增长，加之特定国有金融机构和专营机构依法上缴近年结存的利润、调入预算稳定调节基金等，支出规模比去年扩大2万亿元以上，可用财力明显增加。新增财力要下沉基层，主要用于落实助企纾困、稳就业保民生政策，促进消费、扩大需求。今年安排中央本级支出增长3.9%，其中中央部门支出继续负增长。中央对地方转移支付增加约1.5万亿元、规模近9.8万亿元，增长18%、为多年来最大增幅。中央财政将更多资金纳入直达范围，省级财政也要加大对市县的支持，务必使基层落实惠企利民政策更有能力、更有动力。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;要用好政府投资资金，带动扩大有效投资。今年拟安排地方政府专项债券3.65万亿元。强化绩效导向，坚持“资金、要素跟着项目走”，合理扩大使用范围，支持在建项目后续融资，开工一批具备条件的重大工程、新型基础设施、老旧公用设施改造等建设项目。民间投资在投资中占大头，要发挥重大项目牵引和政府投资撬动作用，完善相关支持政策，充分调动民间投资积极性。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;要坚持政府过紧日子，更好节用裕民。大力优化支出结构，保障重点支出，严控一般性支出。盘活财政存量资金和闲置资产。各级政府必须艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约，中央政府和省级政府要带头。加强收支管理，严禁铺张浪费，不得违规新建楼堂馆所，不得搞形象工程，对违反财经纪律、肆意挥霍公款的要严查重处，一定要把宝贵资金用在发展紧要处、民生急需上。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;加大稳健的货币政策实施力度。发挥货币政策工具的总量和结构双重功能，为实体经济提供更有力支持。扩大新增贷款规模，保持货币供应量和社会融资规模增速与名义经济增速基本匹配，保持宏观杠杆率基本稳定。保持人民币汇率在合理均衡水平上的基本稳定。进一步疏通货币政策传导机制，引导资金更多流向重点领域和薄弱环节，扩大普惠金融覆盖面。推动金融机构降低实际贷款利率、减少收费，让广大市场主体切身感受到融资便利度提升、综合融资成本实实在在下降。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;强化就业优先政策。大力拓宽就业渠道，注重通过稳市场主体来稳就业，增强创业带动就业作用。财税、金融等政策都要围绕就业优先实施，加大对企业稳岗扩岗的支持力度。各类专项促就业政策要强化优化，对就业创业的不合理限制要坚决清理取消。各地都要千方百计稳定和扩大就业。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;确保粮食能源安全。保障粮食等重要农产品供应，继续做好能源、重要原材料保供稳价工作，保障民生和企业正常生产经营用电。实施全面节约战略。增强国内资源生产保障能力，加快油气、矿产等资源勘探开发，完善国家战略物资储备制度，保障初级产品供给。打击哄抬物价等行为。保持物价水平基本稳定。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;防范化解重大风险。继续按照稳定大局、统筹协调、分类施策、精准拆弹的基本方针，做好经济金融领域风险防范和处置工作。压实地方属地责任、部门监管责任和企业主体责任，加强风险预警、防控机制和能力建设，设立金融稳定保障基金，发挥存款保险制度和行业保障基金的作用，运用市场化、法治化方式化解风险隐患，有效应对外部冲击，牢牢守住不发生系统性风险的底线。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Achieving stable macroeconomic performance and keeping major economic indicators within the appropriate range<br/>We must continue to ensure stability on six fronts and maintain security in six areas. We have both macro-policy tools and space available to us, and we should use them to intensify cross- and counter-cyclical adjustments and to provide strong support for a stable economic performance.<br/>We will see that the proactive fiscal policy is more effective. We have set the deficit-to-GDP ratio for the year at around 2.8 percent, slightly lower than last year, and this will boost fiscal sustainability. It is projected that fiscal revenue will continue to grow in 2022. In addition, we also have available to us the surplus profits of state-owned financial institutions and state monopoly business operations from recent years turned over in accordance with the law and funds transferred from the Central Budget Stabilization Fund. This will make it possible for government to increase expenditures by more than two trillion yuan over last year, putting significantly greater fiscal resources at our disposal. New funds will be channeled to local levels of government and used mainly to ease the difficulties of enterprises, stabilize employment, meet living needs, and increase consumption and demand.<br/>This year, central government expenditures will rise by 3.9 percent, but the budgetary spending of central government departments will continue to register negative growth. Central government transfer payments to local governments will come to close to 9.8 trillion yuan. This figure represents a growth of 18 percent, or around 1.5 trillion yuan, and is the largest increase in recent years. The central government will place more budgetary funds under the mechanism for direct allocation to prefecture- and county-level governments, and provincial-level governments should also provide additional fiscal support to these levels. It is imperative that local governments are both able and motivated to carry out policies that will benefit businesses and people.<br/>We will use government investment funds to stimulate and expand effective investment. This year, special-purpose bonds for local governments will total 3.65 trillion yuan. We will, taking a performance-oriented approach, ensure that investment funds and other production factors stay with projects they are allocated to, while appropriately widening the scope of usage for such factors. We will support follow-up financing for ongoing projects, and begin construction on major projects that are ready for launching, new types of infrastructure, and renovations of outdated public facilities.<br/>The lion’s share of investment in China comes from the non-government sector. We will give full play to the leveraging role of major projects and government investment and refine relevant supporting policies to keep non-government investors fully motivated.<br/>Government will keep its belt tightened and keep spending low to benefit the people. We will improve the mix of government spending so as to ensure funding for key areas and strictly control general expenditures. Budgetary funds and assets sitting idle will be put into good use. Governments at every level need to operate within their means and economize where possible, and central and provincial-level governments should take the lead in this regard.<br/>Management of fiscal receipts and outlays will be tightened up, and wasteful and excessive spending will be prohibited. We will prevent the construction of new government buildings in violation of regulations. No vanity projects will be tolerated, and anyone who violates fiscal discipline or squanders public funds will be investigated and severely punished. We must ensure that our precious funds are used in areas that are critical to development and to meet the urgent needs of the people.<br/>We will step up implementation of the prudent monetary policy. We will use monetary policy tools to adjust both the monetary aggregate and the monetary structure, so as to provide more robust support for the real economy. We will expand the scale of new loans, see that increases in money supply and aggregate financing are generally in step with nominal economic growth, and keep the macro leverage ratio generally stable. The RMB exchange rate will be kept generally stable at an adaptive, balanced level.<br/>We will further improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, channel more funds into key areas and weak links, and expand the coverage of inclusive finance. Financial institutions will be encouraged to lower real loan interest rates and cut fees, so as to truly make it easier for market entities to access financing and achieve a considerable drop in overall financing costs.<br/>We will strengthen the employment-first policy. We will work to broaden the employment channels, promote employment stability by keeping the operations of market entities stable, and harness the role of business startups in boosting employment. Fiscal and financial policies will facilitate implementation of the employment-first policy, and greater support will be provided for enterprises to stabilize and expand employment. All dedicated employment policies will be strengthened and improved, and we will resolutely act to overhaul or abolish excessive restrictions on employment and business startups. All local governments must use every possible means to stabilize employment and expand it further.<br/>We will ensure food and energy security. We will ensure the supply of grain and other major agricultural products, as well as the supply and price stability of energy and important raw materials, and guarantee sufficient electricity to meet people’s living needs and conduct normal business production and operations. We will implement a comprehensive resource conservation strategy. To enhance China’s capacity for resource production and supply, we will step up petroleum, natural gas and mineral exploration and development, improve the national strategic goods reserve system, and ensure the supply of primary products. We will crack down on price gouging, and ensure price levels are kept generally stable.<br/>We will prevent and defuse major risks. We will continue to guard against and address economic and financial risks in accordance with the fundamental principles of maintaining overall stability, ensuring coordination, implementing category-based policies, and defusing risks through targeted efforts. We will see that local governments fulfill their responsibilities, the competent government departments tighten regulation, and enterprises shoulder primary responsibility. We will make stronger efforts to give early-warning of risks, enhance risk prevention and control mechanisms, and build capacities for responding to risks. A fund for ensuring financial stability will be established, the deposit insurance system and industry guarantee funds will be brought fully into play, and market- and law-based methods will be used to defuse risks and potential dangers and to respond to external shocks. All these efforts will ensure that no systemic risks arise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;（二）着力稳市场主体保就业，加大宏观政策实施力度。完善减负纾困等政策，夯实经济稳定运行、质量提升的基础。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;实施新的组合式税费支持政策。坚持阶段性措施和制度性安排相结合，减税与退税并举。一方面，延续实施扶持制造业、小微企业和个体工商户的减税降费政策，并提高减免幅度、扩大适用范围。对小规模纳税人阶段性免征增值税。对小微企业年应纳税所得额100万元至300万元部分，再减半征收企业所得税。各地也要结合实际，依法出台税费减免等有力措施，使减税降费力度只增不减，以稳定市场预期。另一方面，综合考虑为企业提供现金流支持、促进就业消费投资，大力改进因增值税税制设计类似于先缴后退的留抵退税制度，今年对留抵税额提前实行大规模退税。优先安排小微企业，对小微企业的存量留抵税额于6月底前一次性全部退还，增量留抵税额足额退还。重点支持制造业，全面解决制造业、科研和技术服务、生态环保、电力燃气、交通运输等行业留抵退税问题。增值税留抵退税力度显著加大，以有力提振市场信心。预计全年退税减税约2.5万亿元，其中留抵退税约1.5万亿元，退税资金全部直达企业。中央财政将加大对地方财力支持，补助资金直达市县，地方政府及有关部门要建立健全工作机制，加强资金调度，确保退税减税这项关键性举措落实到位，为企业雪中送炭，助企业焕发生机。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;加强金融对实体经济的有效支持。用好普惠小微贷款支持工具，增加支农支小再贷款，优化监管考核，推动普惠小微贷款明显增长、信用贷款和首贷户比重继续提升。引导金融机构准确把握信贷政策，继续对受疫情影响严重的行业企业给予融资支持，避免出现行业性限贷、抽贷、断贷。发挥好政策性、开发性金融作用。推进涉企信用信息整合共享，加快税务、海关、电力等单位与金融机构信息联通，扩大政府性融资担保对小微企业的覆盖面，努力营造良好融资生态，进一步推动解决实体经济特别是中小微企业融资难题。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;推动降低企业生产经营成本。清理转供电环节不合理加价，支持地方对特殊困难行业用电实行阶段性优惠政策。引导大型平台企业降低收费，减轻中小商户负担。进一步清理规范行业协会商会、中介机构等收费。要开展涉企违规收费专项整治行动，建立协同治理和联合惩戒机制，坚决查处乱收费、乱罚款、乱摊派。要加大拖欠中小企业账款清理力度，规范商业承兑汇票使用，机关、事业单位和国有企业要带头清欠。餐饮、住宿、零售、文化、旅游、客运等行业就业容量大、受疫情影响重，各项帮扶政策都要予以倾斜，支持这些行业企业挺得住、过难关、有奔头。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;落实落细稳就业举措。延续执行降低失业和工伤保险费率等阶段性稳就业政策。对不裁员少裁员的企业，继续实施失业保险稳岗返还政策，明显提高中小微企业返还比例。今年高校毕业生超过1000万人，要加强就业创业指导、政策支持和不断线服务。做好退役军人安置和就业保障，促进农民工就业，帮扶残疾人、零就业家庭成员就业。深入开展大众创业万众创新，增强双创平台服务能力。加强灵活就业服务，完善灵活就业社会保障政策，开展新就业形态职业伤害保障试点。坚决防止和纠正性别、年龄、学历等就业歧视，大力营造公平就业环境。加强劳动保障监察执法，着力解决侵害劳动者合法权益的突出问题。增强公共就业服务针对性。继续开展大规模职业技能培训，共建共享一批公共实训基地。使用1000亿元失业保险基金支持稳岗和培训，加快培养制造业高质量发展的急需人才，让更多劳动者掌握一技之长、让三百六十行行行人才辈出。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Keeping the operations of market entities stable and maintaining job security by strengthening macro policies<br/>We will improve policies for easing the burdens and difficulties of market entities and create a stronger foundation for achieving a stable and sounder economic performance.<br/>We will implement a new package of tax-and-fee policies to support enterprises. We will continue to take temporary steps and institutional measures and apply policies for both tax reductions and refunds.<br/>First, we will extend tax and fee reduction policies that support manufacturing, micro and small enterprises and self-employed individuals, and expand the scale and scope of these policies. A temporary exemption on VAT payments will be granted to small taxpayers. Corporate income tax on annual taxable income of between one million and three million yuan will be halved once again for micro and small enterprises. Local governments should also adopt effective tax-and-fee reduction steps based on local conditions and in accordance with the law to maintain the scale of tax-and-fee reductions and keep market expectations stable.<br/>Second, to improve the cash flow of enterprises, promote employment- and consumption-driven investment, and further improve the system for refunding excess input VAT credits, we will issue VAT credit refunds ahead of time this year on a big scale. We will give priority to micro and small enterprises, refunding outstanding VAT credits to them in one lump sum by the end of June, while also fully refunding newly added credits. With a focus on supporting manufacturing, we will work to fully resolve problems in refunding VAT credits in manufacturing, research and technical services, environmental protection, electricity and gas, and transportation industries. Such a substantial increase in VAT credit refunds will help strongly boost market confidence.<br/>Tax refunds and cuts are expected to total 2.5 trillion yuan this year. VAT credit refunds will account for 1.5 trillion yuan of this sum and all go straight to enterprises. The central government will provide greater fiscal support for local governments and allocate fiscal subsidies directly to the prefecture and county levels. Local governments and relevant departments should develop sound systems to allocate funds more effectively. We must ensure that the critically important policy of tax refunds and cuts takes full effect, in order to provide enterprises with timely assistance and help them generate fresh vitality.<br/>We will encourage the financial sector to provide more effective support to the real economy. We will make good use of instruments to support inclusive loans to micro and small businesses, and increase re-lending for agricultural and small enterprises. We will strengthen supervision and assessment to promote a marked increase in inclusive loans to micro and small businesses and a further rise in the proportion of collateral-free loans and first-time loans. We will see that financial institutions have a good understanding of credit policies, ensure continued financing support for industries and enterprises hit hard by Covid-19, and prevent industry-wide lending restrictions, forced early repayment of loans, and arbitrary termination of loan agreements.<br/>We will make good use of policy-backed and development finance. We will promote the sharing of enterprise credit information and move faster to achieve information integration and sharing between financial institutions and tax offices, customs, electric utilities and other agencies. The government financing guaranty will be expanded to cover more micro and small businesses. We will strive to create a favorable financing environment and help resolve the financing difficulties of enterprises in the real economy, especially MSMEs.<br/>We will help lower business costs. We will rectify excessive surcharges levied by utility companies, and support local governments in adopting temporary preferential policies on electricity use for industries which are experiencing particular difficulty. We will encourage large platform enterprises to lower service fees and lighten the burden on small and medium businesses. Further steps will be taken to regulate and overhaul fees charged by industry associations, chambers of commerce, and intermediaries.<br/>We will launch initiatives to end unjustified charges levied on businesses, and develop mechanisms for coordinated regulation and joint punishment. We will fully investigate and punish the imposition of arbitrary charges, fines, and quotas.<br/>We will intensify efforts to get outstanding payments owed to small and medium enterprises cleared. We will standardize the usage of commercial acceptance bills, and ensure that government bodies, public institutions, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) take the lead in clearing overdue payments.<br/>Catering, hospitality, retail, culture, tourism, and passenger transport sectors have a large capacity for employment. However, they have been severely affected by Covid-19. Support policies will be weighted more heavily toward enterprises in these sectors to help them stay afloat and get through challenging times with bright prospects.<br/>We will fully implement all measures to stabilize employment.
