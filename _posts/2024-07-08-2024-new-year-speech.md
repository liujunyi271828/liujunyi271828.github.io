新年前夕，国家主席习近平通过中央广播电视总台和互联网，发表了二〇二四年新年贺词。全文如下：

On New Year's Eve, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered his 2024 New Year message via China Media Group and the Internet. The following is the full text of the message:

大家好！冬至阳生，岁回律转。在这辞旧迎新的美好时刻，我在北京向大家致以新年的祝福！

Greetings to you all! As energy rises after the Winter Solstice, we are about to bid farewell to the old year and usher in the new. From Beijing, I extend my best New Year wishes to each and every one of you!

2023年，我们接续奋斗、砥砺前行，经历了风雨洗礼，看到了美丽风景，取得了沉甸甸的收获。大家记住了一年的不易，也对未来充满信心。

In 2023, we have continued to forge ahead with resolve and tenacity. We have gone through the test of winds and rains, have seen beautiful scenes unfolding on the way, and have made plenty real achievements. We will remember this year as one of hard work and perseverance. Going forward, we have full confidence in the future.

这一年的步伐，我们走得很坚实。疫情防控平稳转段，我国经济持续回升向好，高质量发展扎实推进。现代化产业体系更加健全，一批高端化、智能化、绿色化新型支柱产业快速崛起。粮食生产“二十连丰”，绿水青山成色更足，乡村振兴展现新气象。东北全面振兴谱写新篇，雄安新区拔节生长，长江经济带活力脉动，粤港澳大湾区勇立潮头。中国经济在风浪中强健了体魄、壮实了筋骨。

This year, we have marched forward with solid steps. We achieved a smooth transition in our COVID-19 response efforts. The Chinese economy has sustained the momentum of recovery. Steady progress has been made in pursuing high-quality development. Our modernized industrial system has been further upgraded. A number of advanced, smart and green industries are rapidly emerging as new pillars of the economy. We have secured a bumper harvest for the 20th year in a row. Waters have become clearer and mountains greener. New advances have been made in pursuing rural revitalization. New progress has been made in fully revitalizing northeast China. The Xiong'an New Area is growing fast, the Yangtze River Economic Belt is full of vitality, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is embracing new development opportunities. Having weathered the storm, the Chinese economy is more resilient and dynamic than before.

这一年的步伐，我们走得很有力量。经过久久为功的磨砺，中国的创新动力、发展活力勃发奔涌。C919大飞机实现商飞，国产大型邮轮完成试航，神舟家族太空接力，“奋斗者”号极限深潜。国货潮牌广受欢迎，国产新手机一机难求，新能源汽车、锂电池、光伏产品给中国制造增添了新亮色。中国以自强不息的精神奋力攀登，到处都是日新月异的创造。

This year, we have marched forward with robust steps. Thanks to years of dedicated efforts, China's innovation-driven development is full of energy. The C919 large passenger airliner entered commercial service. The Chinese-built large cruise ship completed its trial voyage. The Shenzhou spaceships are continuing their missions in space. The deep-sea manned submersible Fendouzhe reached the deepest ocean trench. Products designed and made in China, especially trendy brands, are highly popular with consumers. The latest models of Chinese-made mobile phones are an instant market success. New energy vehicles, lithium batteries, and photovoltaic products are a new testimony to China's manufacturing prowess. Everywhere across our country, new heights are being scaled with dogged determination, and new creations and innovations are emerging every day.

这一年的步伐，我们走得很见神采。成都大运会、杭州亚运会精彩纷呈，体育健儿勇创佳绩。假日旅游人潮涌动，电影市场红红火火，“村超”、“村晚”活力四射，低碳生活渐成风尚，温暖的生活气息、复苏的忙碌劲头，诠释了人们对美好幸福的追求，也展现了一个活力满满、热气腾腾的中国。

This year, we have marched forward in high spirits. The Chengdu FISU World University Games and the Hangzhou Asian Games presented spectacular sports scenes, and Chinese athletes excelled in their competitions. Tourist destinations are full of visitors on holidays, and the film market is booming. The "village super league" football games and "village spring festival gala" are immensely popular. More people are embracing low-carbon lifestyles. All these exhilarating activities have made our lives richer and more colorful, and they mark the return of bustling life across the country. They embody people's pursuit of a beautiful life, and present a vibrant and flourishing China to the world.

这一年的步伐，我们走得很显底气。中国是一个伟大的国度，传承着伟大的文明。在这片辽阔的土地上，大漠孤烟、江南细雨，总让人思接千载、心驰神往；黄河九曲、长江奔流，总让人心潮澎湃、豪情满怀。良渚、二里头的文明曙光，殷墟甲骨的文字传承，三星堆的文化瑰宝，国家版本馆的文脉赓续……泱泱中华，历史何其悠久，文明何其博大，这是我们的自信之基、力量之源。

This year, we have marched forward with great confidence. China is a great country with a great civilization. Across this vast expanse of land, wisps of smoke in deserts of the north and drizzles in the south invoke our fond memory of many millennium-old stories. The mighty Yellow River and Yangtze River never fail to inspire us. Discoveries at the archeological sites of Liangzhu and Erlitou tell us much about the dawn of Chinese civilization. The ancient Chinese characters inscribed on oracle bones of the Yin Ruins, the cultural treasures of the Sanxingdui Site, and the collections of the National Archives of Publications and Culture bear witness to the evolution of Chinese culture. All this stands as testament to the time-honored history of China and its splendid civilization. And all this is the source from which our confidence and strength are derived.

中国不仅发展自己，也积极拥抱世界，担当大国责任。我们成功举办中国－中亚峰会、第三届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛，一系列主场外交迎来五洲宾朋。我也访问了一些国家，出席了一些国际会议，会晤了不少老朋友、新伙伴，分享中国主张，深化彼此共识。世事变迁，和平发展始终是主旋律，合作共赢始终是硬道理。

While pursuing its development, China has also embraced the world and fulfilled its responsibility as a major country. We held the China-Central Asia Summit and the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, and hosted leaders from across the world at many diplomatic events held in China. I also paid visits to a number of countries, attended international conferences, and met many friends, both old and new. I shared China's vision and enhanced common understandings with them. No matter how the global landscape may evolve, peace and development remain the underlying trend, and only cooperation for mutual benefit can deliver.

前行路上，有风有雨是常态。一些企业面临经营压力，一些群众就业、生活遇到困难，一些地方发生洪涝、台风、地震等自然灾害，这些我都牵挂在心。大家不惧风雨、守望相助，直面挑战、攻坚克难，我深受感动。辛勤劳作的农民，埋头苦干的工人，敢闯敢拼的创业者，保家卫国的子弟兵，各行各业的人们都在挥洒汗水，每一个平凡的人都作出了不平凡的贡献！人民永远是我们战胜一切困难挑战的最大依靠。

Along the way, we are bound to encounter headwinds. Some enterprises had a tough time. Some people had difficulty finding jobs and meeting basic needs. Some places were hit by floods, typhoons, earthquakes or other natural disasters. All these remain at the forefront of my mind. When I see people rising to the occasion, reaching out to each other in adversity, meeting challenges head-on and overcoming difficulties, I am deeply moved. All of you, from farmers in the fields to workers on factory floors, from entrepreneurs blazing the trail to service members guarding our country -- indeed, people from all walks of life -- have done your very best. Each and every ordinary Chinese has made an extraordinary contribution! You, the people, are the ones we look to when we fight to prevail over all difficulties or challenges.

明年是新中国成立75周年。我们要坚定不移推进中国式现代化，完整、准确、全面贯彻新发展理念，加快构建新发展格局，推动高质量发展，统筹好发展和安全。要坚持稳中求进、以进促稳、先立后破，巩固和增强经济回升向好态势，实现经济行稳致远。要全面深化改革开放，进一步提振发展信心，增强经济活力，以更大力度办教育、兴科技、育人才。要继续支持香港、澳门发挥自身优势，在更好融入国家发展大局中保持长期繁荣稳定。祖国统一是历史必然，两岸同胞要携手同心，共享民族复兴的伟大荣光。

Next year will mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We will steadfastly advance Chinese modernization, fully and faithfully apply the new development philosophy on all fronts, speed up building the new development paradigm, promote high-quality development, and both pursue development and safeguard security. We will continue to act on the principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, promoting stability through progress, and establishing the new before abolishing the old. We will consolidate and strengthen the momentum of economic recovery, and work to achieve steady and long-term economic development. We will deepen reform and opening up across the board, further enhance people's confidence in development, promote vibrant development of the economy, and redouble efforts to boost education, advance science and technology and cultivate talents. We will continue to support Hong Kong and Macao in harnessing their distinctive strengths, better integrating themselves into China's overall development, and securing long-term prosperity and stability. China will surely be reunified, and all Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should be bound by a common sense of purpose and share in the glory of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

我们的目标很宏伟，也很朴素，归根到底就是让老百姓过上更好的日子。孩子的抚养教育，年轻人的就业成才，老年人的就医养老，是家事也是国事，大家要共同努力，把这些事办好。现在，社会节奏很快，大家都很忙碌，工作生活压力都很大。我们要营造温暖和谐的社会氛围，拓展包容活跃的创新空间，创造便利舒适的生活条件，让大家心情愉快、人生出彩、梦想成真。

Our goal is both inspiring and simple. Ultimately, it is about delivering a better life for the people. Our children should be well taken care of and receive good education. Our young people should have the opportunities to pursue their careers and succeed. And our elderly people should have adequate access to medical services and elderly care. These issues matter to every family, and they are also a top priority of the government. We must work together to deliver on these issues. Today, in our fast-paced society, people are all busy and face a lot of pressure in work and life. We should foster a warm and harmonious atmosphere in our society, expand the inclusive and dynamic environment for innovation, and create convenient and good living conditions, so that the people can live happy lives, bring out their best, and realize their dreams.

当前，世界上还有一些地方处在战火硝烟之中。中国人民深知和平的珍贵，我们愿同国际社会一道，以人类前途为怀、以人民福祉为念，推动构建人类命运共同体，建设更加美好的世界。

As I speak to you, conflicts are still raging in some parts of the world. We Chinese are keenly aware of what peace means. We will work closely with the international community for the common good of humanity, build a community with a shared future for mankind, and make the world a better place for all.

此时此刻，夜色斑斓，万家灯火。让我们一起，祝愿祖国繁荣昌盛、世界和平安宁！祝愿大家福暖四季、顺遂安康！

Right at this moment, when the lights in millions of homes light up the evening sky, let us all wish our great country prosperity, and let us all wish the world peace and tranquility! I wish you happiness in all the four seasons and success and good health in the year ahead!

谢谢大家！

Thank you!
