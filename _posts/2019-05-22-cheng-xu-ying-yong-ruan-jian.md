其实这几年我也一直在想这个问题. 我个人觉着, 这种事儿就和现在的销售所干的不叫卖产品了, 而是给吹成卖解决方案是类似的...当然, 还是查查比较好.

The two programs depend on the OS, whereby the OS itself or your internal BIOS programming are not 'apps' in the technical sense as they communicate directly with the computer hardware itself.

> Great question! All these words are often used interchangeably, but there is a technical difference.

> **Software** - the programs and other operating information used by a computer. 
> Software can be made up of more than one program. All-encompassing term that is often used in contrast to hardware (the tangible parts of a computer)
>
> **Application** - A program or group of programs that is designed for the **end user**. 
> Application software (an application) is a set of computer programs designed to permit the user to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities. Application software cannot run on itself but is dependent on system software to execute.
>
> **Program** - A set of instructions telling a computer what to do. 
> "All applications are programs, but a program is not necessarily an application. For example, there are always lots of programs running on the background of an operating system, but since they weren't developed for the end-user, they are not applications. On the other hand, Windows Media Player and Firefox, for example, are applications. They have a Graphical User Interface."
