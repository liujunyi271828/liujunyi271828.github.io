不知道怎么回事儿突然想起这首诗。

初中的时候学过这首诗的中文版。当时还太年轻，自然是什么都不懂的。现在想起来回头再看，真香。讲道理初一安排这首诗有些浪费，不知道现在编教材那帮人改没改。

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br/>
Though as for that the passing there<br/>
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay<br/>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br/>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br/>
I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
And that has made all the difference.
